<p class="center">BY RICHARD GRANT WHITE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In the course of our two foregoing articles we followed the
advance of the great Aryan or Indo-European race, to
which we belong, from its original seat in Central Asia, which
it began to leave more than four thousand years ago, until we
found it in possession of India, Persia, and all of Europe. We
considered briefly and incidentally the fact that within the
last two hundred and fifty years this Asiatic race has taken absolute
possession of the greater part of the continent of North
America. We saw that speech was the bond and the token of
the now vast and vague, but once narrow and compact, unity
of this powerful race, which was brought into existence to conquer,
to rule, and to humanize the world. Of the numerous
languages which have sprung from the Aryan stem, English is
the youngest. Compared in age with any other language of
that stock, we may almost say with any existing language of
any stock, it is like a new born babe in the presence of hoary
eld. Only eight hundred years ago it was unknown. True,
its rudiments and much of its substance then existed; but so it
might be said that they existed in a certain degree four thousand
years ago, as we saw in our last article. Yet again, more
than four hundred years passed away before modern English
was born. It was not until about the beginning of the sixteenth
century that the language of Spenser, of Shakspere, of
the Bible, of Bunyan, of Milton, of Goldsmith, Burke, Irving,
Hawthorne, and Thackeray, came fully into existence as the
recognized established speech of the English race.</p>

<p>Since that time the changes it has undergone have been
trivial and unimportant. Like the languages of all other highly
civilized peoples, it has received many additions, but its essential
character has not changed; its structure has been modified
so slightly that the change is perceptible only on the closest
examination; its syntactical construction has remained unshaken.
The prose of Spenser and Shakspere and the correspondence
of the educated men of their day is as easily understood
by an unlettered English speaking man of our day as
the prose of Sir Arthur Helps or the more intelligible passages
in the daily newspapers. During that time, indeed, there have
been changes of style in writing English, which are more or
less distinctive of periods. A reader of moderate experience
and discrimination can soon tell whether a page that is put
before him was written in the Elizabethan period, in that of
the Restoration (Charles II.), in that of Queen Anne, or that of
Victoria. But the differences by which his judgment would be
guided are differences of tone, of manner, of “the way of putting
things,” of certain tricks of expression, and are without any
relations whatever to the “grammar,” or to the essential character
of language. The presence of words not in use at one
period, but which came into use at another, is an important
means of such a discrimination. But, in the first place, the
introduction of new words does not modify the essential character
of a language; and in the next we are not now considering
a criticism which goes so far as to examine the history of
the English vocabulary.</p>

<p>This modern English, which is the youngest, is also the
greatest language ever spoken. A man may be supposed, not
unreasonably, to be prejudiced in favor of his mother tongue;
but the judgment that declares in favor of English against all
other languages, even Greek, needs neither motive nor support
from prejudice. The two facts, that the English language is
the vehicle and the medium of a literature unequaled by that
produced in any other known tongue, and that it is becoming
the common intermediary and most widely diffused speech of
the world, show that it possesses in the highest degree the two
essential elements of a great and complete language—adaptation
to man’s highest and to his homeliest needs in expression.
There is no other known language in which “King Lear,” “Hamlet,”
“Antony and Cleopatra,” the Falstaff scenes in “King Henry
the Fourth,” “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” “Paradise Lost,” the
Roger de Coverley papers of the “Spectator,” “The Elegy in
a Country Churchyard,” “The Vicar of Wakefield” and “She
Stoops to Conquer,” “The School for Scandal,” “Waverley,”
“The Antiquary” and “The Fortunes of Nigel,” “Childe Harold”
and “Don Juan,” “The Pickwick Papers,” “Henry Esmond,”
“Adam Bede” and “Romola,” “In Memoriam” and “Sir Galahad,”
“The Earthly Paradise,” “Child Roland” and “The
Scarlet Letter” could <i>all</i> have been written. No other language
is at once grand enough and simple enough, strong
enough and flexible enough, lofty enough and homely enough
to be the natural, fitting and complete utterance of the literature
of which these are the typical productions, and to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
moreover, at the same time perfectly adapted to the needs of
the jurist, the politician, the man of business, and the mariner.
I remember that once on the St. Lawrence, on the way to
Quebec, as the steamer came to a landing, the French officer
on the “bridge” screamed an order to the engineer, “<i>Arretez
donc, Alphonse! arretez donc!</i>”<a href="#english1" id="anch_english1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and that then I recollected
that the day before on the British steamer in which I left Montreal,
the English officer in just the same situation had quietly
said, in his strong, firm voice, “Hold hard!” and that I then
thought not only how much more effective those two syllables
were as a phrase of nautical command, but that they might be
used by an English poet in a passage of grand and strong emotion.
English has no words which are too great or too little,
too fine or too homely to be used when need requires. English
words change their character and their expression according
to their connection and the manner in which they are uttered.</p>

<p>English owes its supremacy first, to the vigorous vitality of
its germ and the clean robustness of its stem; next, to the rich
and infinitely varied word-growth, which this trunk supports
and nourishes. All languages are more or less composite, but
of all languages English is most composite. It has been
largely and richly grafted. It is, of all languages, the most
complex in substance, and the simplest in structure. This
simplicity of structure enables the uneducated man—Bunyan,
for example—to use it with correctness and force, while the
vast variety of its substance adapts it to all the needs of poet
and philosopher. Let us see how such a language came into
existence, and what it is.</p>

<p>The people which spoke the English language when it assumed
its modern form, had made it. This may seem to be
the sort of truth which is triteness; but it is not so. The people
which speaks a language generally does make it; but not
always, as we shall see. The people who made the English
language, and who made England, were of that part of the
great Aryan family which had taken possession of the northwestern
part of Europe—that which lies around the southern
and western part of the Baltic Sea. It is commonly said that
the English are a very composite and heterogeneous people.
In a narrow sense this is true, but in a large and really significant
sense it is quite untrue. In his welcome to the Danish
princess Alexandra, when she arrived in England to become
Princess of Wales, the poet laureate prettily availed himself of
the minor truth, to sing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Saxon and Dane and Norman are we,</div>
<div class="verse i1">But all of us Danes in our welcome of thee, Alexandra!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The English race is, and for more than five hundred years
has been compounded of Saxons (Angles, Saxons and Jutes),
Danes and Normans. But these three peoples were of such
close kindred that, in Launcelot Gobbo’s phrase, they were
“cater cousins.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> They were all Goths; the Danes and the
Normans were both Scandinavians; and the Saxons, the Angles,
and particularly the Jutes, although they were Low German
tribes (the term Low German meaning merely inhabitants
of the lower parts of Germany near the sea) were, because of
their origin, and also of their neighborhood to the others, so
like them in blood and in speech that the difference was rather
superficial than essential.</p>

<p>These Jutes, Angles and Saxons, continuing the armed Aryan
progress westward, went to Britain in companies of hundreds
and thousands, and fighting their way from the shore
inland at various points, and continually reinforced from their
hive on the continent, in the course of about one hundred and
fifty years they obtained complete possession of the island, from
the Tweed to the Channel, excepting only the mountainous
part at the west, now called Wales. They seem not to have
mingled with the conquered Britains, who it will be remembered
were Celts, but to have wholly displaced them, to have
swept the land clean of them, except in Wales, the Highlands
of Scotland, and a small remnant in Cornwall, the extreme
southwestern point of the island. They carried with them
their Scandinavian-tinged Low German speech (called for
convenience Anglo-Saxon), which became the language of the
country whose name their presence and possession changed
from Britain to Angle-land, Engel-land, England. But when
they had established themselves they were not left undisturbed.
The Danes poured in upon them at the north, and soon getting
foot-hold, they in their turn attempted the conquest of the
whole island. They succeeded so nearly that they not only
obtained possession of the northern part of the England of
that day, but of the government; and three Danish kings<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> ruled
the land at London. They did not, however, like the Anglo-Saxons,
destroy their predecessors; partly from lack of strength
to accomplish such a destruction, and partly, it would seem,
from affinities of race and habits of life. Danes and Anglo-Saxons
mingled; although the former were chiefly confined to
the northern part of the country. One result of this conquest
and intermingling was a modification of the speech of the
country, particularly at the north. It received a strong Scandinavian
infusion, the alterative influence of which has
been recognized more and more by philologists as they have
studied the structure and history of the English language. It
should be said here, and perhaps should have been said before,
that the name Dane had in these early times a large and loose
signification. It was applied, without much discrimination, to
any people that lived in the Scandinavian country—Norway
and Sweden as well as Denmark.</p>

<p>Alfred, that first great Englishman, who, if not the only good
English king, has been approached neither in ability nor worth
by any of his successors to this day, is generally thought of as
having conquered the Danes and extinguished their power in
England; but erroneously. The Danes were worsted by him;
but the Danish settlers in England were not ousted, nor could
they be, for they had become a part of the people; the Danish
influence upon English life was not much minished. It was
within the quarter of a century following Alfred’s death that
the Danish king Sweyne levied an annual tribute of £36,000
upon England, and that Danes were called Lord Danes.
Forty-two years after Alfred, the Danish Canute, son of Sweyne,
was crowned king of England; and the Danish pretensions to
the rule of England were not wholly abandoned until the occurrence
of an event which had little less influence upon the
language of England than upon its fortunes. Edward the
Confessor, the last of the royal line of ancient England, was
little more than king in name and state. The country was
really ruled by a council of six great earls, Danes and English,
who partitioned the control of the country among themselves.
The Anglo-Saxons had invaded Britain, and had conquered the
Celtic Britons and removed them from the soil; the Scandinavian
Danes had invaded England, and partly conquered the
Anglo-Saxons (now called Englishmen), but had not destroyed
their near kinsmen, and the two people had mingled. And
now, in the eleventh century (1066), the Normans invaded
England and conquered its Dano-Anglo-Saxon people in their
turn. Harold, who claimed and obtained the throne, on the
death of Edward the Confessor, as his heir, but not as his descendant
or lineal successor, was himself half Dane, his father
having been Earl of Kent, his mother Gytha, a Danish noblewoman.
The influence of the Scandinavian element on the
character and the language of modern England was very great,
and until of late has been underrated.</p>

<p>The conquest of England by the Normans, and the division
of it into sixty thousand knight’s fees, distributed mostly among
the followers of the Norman duke, who were thus with their
families and followers scattered widely over the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was the cause of one of the most remarkable phenomena
in the history of language—the introduction of Norman-French
as an element of English speech. Some French or
Romance words had come into England before, because
of neighborhood and of affectation of foreign refinement, and
a few Latin words had crept in under favor of the clergy; but
now Norman-French was distributed all through the island as
the speech not only of the holders of the sixty thousand
knight’s fees, but of all their followers, and a considerable
number of their tenants, to say nothing of their adulatory imitators,
or of the Norman clergy who accompanied them to
bless and to share their conquest.</p>

<p>Now who were the Normans, and what was this Norman-French
which they introduced into England? The Normans
were simply North-men from the great Scandinavian peninsula
now divided into Norway and Sweden. They were pirates and
robbers. Bold and bloody on sea and land, they had been for
two or three centuries the scourge and the terror of Southern
Europe. The people on the continent called them simply
“North-men,” the people of England “East-men,” (the name
being determined, it will be seen, by the relative position of
those who gave it), and sometimes, as has been said before,
“Danes.” These sea rovers and raiders effected settlements
in various parts of Europe, but their most important lodgement,
the only one with which we have now any concern, was in
France, which they invaded on the south of the Seine, between
that river and the Loire. Here in the course of less than a hundred
years they had established themselves so firmly that in
the year 912, Charles, the Frankish king, recognized and
enfeoffed<a href="#english2" id="anch_english2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the Viking Rollo, as first Duke of Normandy; Rollo
acknowledging Charles as his over-lord, and receiving baptism—for
the Normans were now, as the Anglo-Saxons had been
until about A. D. 600, pagans. These Gothic Norsemen did
<i>not</i> make the language that they soon came to speak. Conquerors
and rulers although they were, they adopted the language
of the country and the people which they had conquered,
and spoke it with slight Gothic modification. This
was the Norman-French which, only one hundred and fifty
years after they were well settled in the country which they
had seized, and which was called from them “Terra North
manorum,”<a href="#english3" id="anch_english3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or Normandy, they took into England.</p>

<p>This French language (Norman or other) was like many
other things wrongly named. It was not the speech of the
Franks or French, a German tribe, who in the fifth century
conquered the country, and from whom it came to have its
name. What, then, was it? We must turn back a moment.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the column of Aryan immigration
after entering Europe at its southeastern corner, divided;
one division, the Celto-Græco-Italic, following the northern
shore of the Mediterranean, taking possession of the country
there, then pushing up northward to the country once called
Gaul, now France, and finally crossing the English Channel
and taking possession of Britain and Ireland. This column of
immigrants founded, among other states, one which is hitherto
the grandest, most influential fact in the history of the world—Rome,
the city, the republic, and finally the empire of Rome;
the influence of which upon the world has now, after more than
two thousand years, not passed away; for the Roman Catholic
Church, ecclesiastically supreme because it was the Church of
Rome, is still one of the great powers of the earth. The Celtic
peoples in Gaul were conquered by the great Cæsar half a
century before the Christian era. The Romans were wise
conquerors; they made the people whom they conquered Romans.
The Celts of Gaul, during centuries of Roman rule
lost almost all their native habits and customs, among them
their mother tongue. They had Roman customs and laws
and they gradually adopted the Roman language—the Latin.
As might be expected, however, they did not speak pure Latin.
The very people of Rome did not speak pure Latin, if by that we
mean the Latin of Cicero’s orations, and the poems of Horace and
of Virgil. That was a literary language. The popular Latin was
speech much less formal and artificial. But the Celts of Gaul
(or France) spoke this popular Latin much debased, and somewhat
intermixed with Celticisms. The degradation of this
form of Latin went on until the country was successfully invaded
by German tribes in the fifth century. These Franks
and Burgundians, being fewer than the Celto-Roman people
whom they conquered, and inferior in civilization, gradually
adopted their language, which, however, they broke up and
simplified, by ridding it of case endings and tense signs; doing
this for mere convenience sake; they had not the time or
the patience to learn all the Latinish inflections. When about
four hundred years of Frankish rule and influence and intermarriage
had elapsed, it was discovered that the language of
the people had become so greatly unlike Latin that it was
practically another tongue. Wherefore it was decreed in the
year 813 by the Council of Tours that the bishops should address
their clergy and people in the Romance tongue, which
was the name given to this popular modification of the old
Roman (Latin) speech. This the Frank kings and courtiers,
who had continued to speak German, were soon obliged to
adopt; and after the division of Charlemagne’s empire, in the
year 843, German was restricted to the country beyond and
just about the Rhine. The Romance tongue, spoken to the
westward, was rapidly modified by degradation of forms, and
by intermixture of Teutonic words, until it became about the
eleventh century, what is known as Old French. It was a debased
form of this Old French which the Scandinavian North-men,
or Normans, adopted, and finally carried into England,
not only as the court language, but to spread it all over the
country. This, then, is the strange phenomenon in language
which is consequent upon the Norman conquest of England;
that a Gothic people conquering and uniting themselves with
another Gothic people, took into the conquered country, not a
Gothic, but a Romance tongue. When the Norman conquerors
spread themselves over all England, accompanied by their
followers of various ranks (for it is an absurdly erroneous notion
that all the Normans that went to England were nobles, or
even knights), they took there no race of foreign blood. To
the Dano-Anglo-Saxon English stock, they merely added more
of the Danish element. But most strangely, the language
brought in by this victorious body of near kinsmen was the
most foreign that could have been found west of the Caucasus.</p>

<p>At first, with the pride of conquerors, the Normans in England
spoke their own, or rather their adopted tongue. Norman-French
was the language of the court, of the law-courts,
of “society.” English was “vulgar.” This went on for some
generations. The condition of things in this respect could not,
however, remain unchanged. Two tongues can not be spoken
by people in constant intercourse with each other without both
being more or less affected by the contact. This happened.
The English (called Anglo-Saxon or Old English) and the
Norman-French were each modified by the other; they interchanged
words and idioms; each dovetailing itself into the
other, until about the year 1350, when it was discovered that
the distinction of Norman and Englishman had practically
passed away, and that the conqueror, yielding to the steady,
gradual influence of the people and the country he had conquered,
had himself become an Englishman. English had
become the speech of the whole people, and thereafter English
was by decree the language of all public documents, proclamations,
and the like, the language of the court, and of “society.”</p>

<p>Of the English, however, which thus came into vogue, it
must be remembered, first, that it did not prevail in the same
form among all the people, but only among the superior classes
and the middle classes of the best condition; that even among
them it was spoken and written with much variation; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as to the rustic people, they spoke almost as many dialects
of the Old English as there were shires in England. Second,
that this English of 1350 was so unlike both the Old English
of Alfred’s day, four hundred years before, that he would not
have been able to read it without much study, and that it was
equally unlike the English of Queen Anne, four hundred
years later.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Norman-French element into the
English language was a gain, the value of which, in the enrichment
of our tongue, and in its increased adaptability to the
wants of a highly civilized people can not be overestimated.
The Old English (or Anglo-Saxon) was a strong, manly
speech, and not without a certain homely charm and simple
sweetness. It was direct, too, and seemed (but perhaps merely
seemed) to be the speech of an honest people. It was however,
rude, inflexible, limited in its vocabulary, and incapable
of expressing fine distinctions of thought. In all these respects
it was so profited, so endowed, so broadened, so suppled
and so refined by its union with the Romance vocabulary
which was largely grafted upon it, that it blossomed almost
into another language; quite another if its capacities are considered.
An examination of the more particular nature of
these changes, which have direct connection with the practical
use of the language, must be postponed until our next article.</p>

<p>To this two-elemented language, a language composed of
two stocks so different as the Gothic and the Latin, and yet
strangely spoken by a people wholly Gothic and largely Scandinavian
in blood, there came now, or began to come, an addition
which was destined to affect its character greatly, and
without which it would not be the matchless language that it is.
This addition was not an addition of substance, but of spirit,
not of matter but of manner. It came to the English language
because of the bold and independent spirit of the English
race in politics and in religion. It came through the translation
of the Bible into the English tongue. This brought into
the English language, alone among all the languages of the
Indo-European race, not a foreign element indeed, but the informing
spirit of a great literature written in a tongue so radically
unlike all Aryan speech that the existence of the two
would seem wholly incompatible with the theory of evolution,
and to imply two independent creations of man; at least two
independent creations of language. Yet these two languages
or families of languages, the Aryan and the Semitic, seem
to have come into existence in neighboring countries. As our
Aryan forefathers, in their earlier movements, and before their
first division, passed between the Caspian Sea and the Persian
Gulf, they skirted the northern borders of the great peninsula of
Arabia, into which none of them, not even those who turned
southward, seem to have attempted to penetrate. This peninsula
was at that time, we may be sure, although there is neither
evidence of the fact nor testimony to it, occupied by the Semitic
race; a race of great power and peculiar genius, which
has had an influence upon the world hardly less than that of
the Aryan peoples. Why the Aryans did not attempt the conquest
and possession of Arabia, we do not know. But it is to
be remembered that they were then comparatively small in
numbers; and the Semitic race is one at once so warlike and
so sagacious, that the conquest would have been one of the
utmost difficulty, even if it were practicable; and moreover,
that the country is not an inviting one to strangers.</p>

<p>The great function of the Semitic race in the world seems to
have been the conception and the promulgation of the idea
of the One Spiritual God. This idea, to which the race
still holds, spread itself with an all-controlling influence
over the civilized globe. It is the corner stone of the
Christian and the Mohammedan religions. The Semitic race,
of which the Hebrews are a family, has, or had, among its
other gifts, the gift of sublime, intense, and imaginative utterance
in prose and in poetry. In this respect it is without
rival among all the peoples who have or who have had a literature.
To these qualities it adds that of a direct simplicity,
which in pathos (if with art, with an art so hidden as to leave
not even the suggestion of consciousness), attains the power
both of the ideal and the real, and never descends so low as
sentiment. Of fancy, the Hebrew writers (for it is they whom
we are now considering) exhibit none; less it would seem because
of the nature of their themes, than because fancifulness
was foreign to their intensity and loftiness of soul. The writings
forming the most important part of the early Hebrew sacred
literature form also, as we all know, that Old Testament
which fills the largest part of the Bible—that is, the Book
which has been for more than fifteen hundred years held sacred
by all christendom.</p>

<p>This sacred Book—which, even if it did not contain the revelation
of the idea of the One Eternal and Almighty God, and
of his dealings with them who deemed themselves his chosen
people, and the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and of the great
apostle to the Gentiles, would yet be the most remarkable collection
of writings known in literature—it has been the policy
of the church of Rome to keep from the people. Its translation
into the vulgar tongue, and its distribution among the people
at large, have always by that church been most earnestly
discouraged, and even, until a comparatively late date, forbidden.
It is remarkable that its earliest translations were into
languages of Gothic peoples. Bishop Ulphilas’s translation
of the Gospels and a small part of the Old Testament into the
Mæso-Gothic language, in the fourth century, has already been
mentioned. About three centuries later an Anglo-Saxon translation
of the Gospels was made; and there is evidence, as we
are assured by Bosworth,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> in the rubrics<a href="#english4" id="anch_english4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that portions of them
were constantly read in Anglo-Saxon churches. But these
versions did little to bring the Bible before the eyes of the
people at large; and besides, they were, as we have seen, confined
to a very small part of that book. The Old Testament
remained to all intents and purposes in an unknown tongue
until the dawn of the Reformation in England. Wycliffe and
his followers translated the whole of the Bible about 1380; and
from that time, notwithstanding bulls, and anathemas, and
persecutions, this book of books, The Book, became the possession
of the whole English people.</p>

<p>We are concerned here only with the effect of this momentous
work upon the English language. It was great and peculiar.
Wycliffe’s English version was followed in 1535 by Coverdale’s,
which was afterward republished with revision, by Taverner’s,
and by others, including the famous Genevan Bible<a href="#english5" id="anch_english5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
of which fifty editions were published in England within thirty
years. These versions were mostly revisions, each “translator”
availing himself, of course, of the text of his predecessors.
Finally, in 1611, there was made what is known as the
“authorized,” or King James I. version, which has since that
time been, next to their common blood and common speech,
the strongest bond of unity for the English race. But between
the making of Wycliffe’s translation in 1380 and the middle of
the sixteenth century, the Bible had taken strong hold of the
English people. It sank into their hearts; it lifted their
souls; its modes of thought became their modes of thought;
its phrases, their household words. When Puritanism appeared,
and strangely relied upon the Old Testament as its
armory of theological warfare, the thoughts and the words of
the prophets, priests and kings of Israel were the daily intellectual
food of no inconsiderable part of the common people,
and the air of all England was vocal with the phraseology of
Job, of David, of Isaiah, and of Ezekiel. The effect of this
upon the English mode of thought and expression was great
and lasting; enduring even to this day. Its value was inestimable.
By reason of it English diction acquired a simplicity,
a strength, a directness, a largeness of style, a capacity of grandeur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and of pathos, a richness and variety which it otherwise
would not have acquired, and which has not been attained by
the language of any other people. The spirit of Hebrew literature
was transfused into the English mind to such a degree
as to modify its mode of thought and of utterance. This took
place because the diffusion of the Bible happened just at the
time when the language was in a state of transition, and modern
English was in course of formation. Had it not occurred
until afterward, as was the case with other European peoples,
it would have been too late to produce this effect. The English
of Shakspere, of Milton, of Bunyan, and their great successors
would not have existed but for the translation and diffusion
of the Bible among the English people.</p>

<p>This, then, English is: a sturdy Gothic stem, largely and
deeply grafted with Romanic scions, and permeated with the
spirit of Hebrew sublimity and passion. These are the source
elements of the supremacy of the youngest language of
the Aryan stock. It unites all the powers and possibilities of
its congeners, and adds to them those of the speech of the only
other race that has felt and uttered the highest aspirations of humanity,
and largely swayed the course of man’s progress
through his unknown future.</p>

<p>But by what means can a mortal man, the creature of a day
form any idea of eternity? What can we find within the compass
of nature to illustrate it by? With what comparison shall
we compare it?… What are any temporal things,
placed in comparison with those that are eternal? What is
the duration of the long-lived oak, of the ancient castle, of
Trajan’s pillar,<a href="#sunday1" id="anch_sunday1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Pompey’s amphitheater?<a href="#sunday2" id="anch_sunday2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> What is the antiquity
of the Tuscan urns,<a href="#sunday3" id="anch_sunday3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> though probably older than the
foundations of Rome; yea, of the pyramids of Egypt, suppose
they have remained upward of three thousand years; when
laid in the balance with eternity? It vanishes into nothing.
Nay, what is the duration of “the everlasting hills,” figuratively
so called, which have remained ever since the general
deluge, if not from the foundation of the world, in comparison
of eternity? No more than an insignificant cipher. Go farther
yet; consider the duration, from the creation of the first-born
son of God, of Michael, the archangel, in particular, to
the hour when he shall be commissioned to sound his trumpet,
and to utter his mighty voice through the vault of heaven,
“Arise ye dead and come to judgment!” Is it not a moment,
a point, a nothing, in comparison of unfathomable eternity?…
In order to illustrate this, a late author has repeated
that striking thought of St. Cyprian:<a href="#sunday4" id="anch_sunday4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Suppose there were a ball
of sand, as large as the globe of earth; suppose a grain of this
sand were to be annihilated, reduced to nothing, in a thousand
years; yet that whole space of duration, wherein this ball
would be annihilating at the rate of one grain in a thousand
years, would bear infinitely less proportion to eternity, duration
without end, than a single grain would bear to all the
mass!</p>

<p>To infix this important point the more deeply in your mind,
consider another comparison: Suppose the ocean to be so enlarged
as to include all the space between the earth and the
starry heavens. Suppose a drop of water to be annihilated
once in a thousand years; yet that whole space of duration,
wherein this ocean would be annihilating at the rate of one
drop in a thousand years, would be infinitely less in proportion
to eternity than one drop of water to that whole ocean. See
the spirits of the righteous that are already praising God in a
happy eternity! We are ready to say, “How short will it appear
to those who drink of the rivers of pleasure at God’s right
hand!” We are ready to cry out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A day without night</div>
<div class="verse i1">They dwell in his sight,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And eternity seems as a day!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But this is only speaking after the manner of men; for the measures
of long and short are only applicable to time, which admits
of bounds, and not to unbounded duration. This rolls
on (according to our low conceptions) with unutterable, inconceivable
swiftness; if one would not rather say, it does not
roll or move at all, but is one still, immovable ocean. For the
inhabitants of heaven “rest not day and night,” but continually
cry, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord, the God, the Almighty,
who was, and who is, and who is to come!” And when millions
of ages are elapsed, their eternity is but just begun.…
What then is he, how foolish, how mad, in how unutterable
a degree of distraction, who, seeming to have the understanding
of a man, deliberately prefers temporal things to
eternal? Who (allowing that absurd, impossible supposition
that wickedness is happiness—a supposition utterly contrary to
all reason, as well as to matter of fact) prefers the happiness
of a day, say a thousand years, to the happiness of eternity,
in comparison of which, a thousand ages are infinitely less
than a year, a day, a moment?—<i>Wesley’s Sermons.</i></p>

<h3 id="DEC14">[<i>December 14.</i>]</h3>

<p>There are some thoughts which, however old, are always
new, either because they are so broad that we never learn them
thoroughly, or because they are so intensely practical that their
interest is always fresh.… Now, among such thoughts
we may reckon that which all children know—that God loves
every one of us with a special love. It is one of the commonest
thoughts in religion, and yet so amazing that when we come
to look steadily at it we come nigh to not believing it. God
does not look at us merely in the mass and multitude. As we
shall stand single and alone before his judgment seat, so do we
stand, so have we always stood, single and alone before the
eye of his boundless love. This is what each man has to believe
of himself. From all eternity God determined to create
me, not simply a fresh man, not simply the son of my parents,
a new inhabitant of my native country, an additional soul to
do the work of the nineteenth century. But he resolved to
create me such as I am, the me by which I am myself, the me
by which other people know me, a different me from any that
have ever been created hitherto, and from any that will be created
hereafter. Unnumbered possible creatures which God
saw when he chose me, he left to remain in their nothingness.
They might have worshiped him a thousand times better than
I shall ever worship him. They might have been higher, holier,
and more interesting. But there was some nameless
thing about me which he preferred. His love fastened on
something special in me. It was just me, with my individual
peculiarities, the size, shape, fashion, and way of my particular,
single, unmated soul, which in the calmness of his eternal
predilection drew him to create me.…</p>

<p>Must I not infer, then, also, that in the sight of God I stand
in some peculiar relation to the whole of his great world? I
clearly belong to a plan, and have a place to fill, and a work
to do, all which are special; and only my specialty, my particular
me, can fill this place or do this work. This is obvious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and yet it is overwhelming also. I almost sink under the
weight of the thought. It seems to bring God so very near.…
I come in sight of the most overshadowing responsibilities.
Responsibility is the definition of life. It is the inseparable
characteristic of my position as a creature. I am
constantly moving, constantly acting. I move impulsively
and I work negligently. What, then, becomes of my special
place and of my special work? From this point of view life
looks very serious. Surely we must trust God with a huge confidence,
or we shall be frightened into going and burying our
talent in the earth!</p>

<p>Now, what is it about us which was the prime object of God’s
love when he chose us for creation? It can not be put into
words. It is just all that which makes us ourselves, and distinguishes
us from all other selves, whether created or possible.
It was precisely our particularity which God so tenderly and intensely
loved. The sweetness of this thought is almost unbearable.
I draw in my breath as if to convince myself that I am
alive, I lay my hand on my heart to feel its beating. First I
smile, and then I weep. I hardly know what to do with myself,
I am so delightfully entangled in the meshes of divine love.
This specialty of God’s love startles me more and more, the
longer I familiarize myself with it. I am obliged to make acts
of faith in God, acts of faith in all his different perfections, but
the greatest act of faith in this specialty of his love of me, of
such as I am, such as I know myself to be, even such as he
knows me to be. Deeper and perpetually deeper, taller and
perpetually taller, the shadow of my responsibilities is cast
upon me. But it is not a dark shadow, not depressing, but
inspiring; sobering, but not paralyzing. I see plainly that my
love of God must be as special as God’s love of me. I must
love him out of my special place, love him through my special
work; and what is that place, and what is that work? Is not
this precisely the question of questions?—<i>Faber.</i></p>

<p>Though violent persecution is not an event, under the present
circumstances of the Christian profession in this country,
within the range of probability, yet serious and faithful opposition
may be expected. Vigorous attempts will be made to
deprive you of your crown, at one time by an assault on your
doctrinal, at another by efforts to corrupt your practical, principles.
A strong current will set in from the world to obstruct
your progress, swelled by the confluence of false opinions, corrupt
customs, ensnaring examples, and all the elements of vice,
error and impiety, which are leagued in a perpetual confederacy
against God and his Christ. Your faith will often be beset,
not merely by the avowed patrons of error, but by such as
“hold the truth in unrighteousness;” who, never having experienced
the renovating power of divine truth, will be among
the first and foremost to ridicule and oppose its genuine influence.
While you live like the world, you may with impunity
think with the church, but let the doctrines you profess descend
from the head to the heart, and produce there the contrition,
the humility, the purity, the separation from the world which
distinguish the new creature, that world will be armed against
you. “They think it strange that ye run not to the same excess
of riot, speaking evil of you.” In order to stand your
ground, it will be requisite for you to “quit yourselves like
men, and be strong.” Aware that he is everywhere and at all
times surrounded with danger, the life of a Christian is a life
of habitual watchfulness; in solitude, in company; at home,
abroad; in repose and in action; in a state of suffering, or a
state of enjoyment; in the shade of privacy, or in the glare of
publicity. Aware of his incessant liability to be ensnared, he
feels it incumbent on him to watch. The melancholy history
of the falls of Noah, of David, and of Peter, is adapted and
designed to teach us this lesson.</p>

<p>An opportunity may present itself, perhaps, in your future
course, of growing suddenly rich, of making at least a considerable
accession to your property; but it involves the sacrifice
of principle, the adoption of some crooked and sinister policy,
some palpable violation of the golden rule; or, to put it in the
most favorable light, such an immersion of your mind in the
cares and business of the world as will leave no leisure for retirement,
no opportunity for “exercising yourself unto godliness,”
no space for calm meditation and the serious perusal of
the Scriptures. Are you prepared in such a conjuncture to reject
the temptation; or are you resolved at all events to make
haste to get rich, though it may plunge you into the utmost
spiritual danger? “Count the cost;” for with such a determination
you can not be Christ’s disciple.</p>

<p>By the supposition with which we set out, you have solemnly
renounced the indulgence of sinful pleasures. But recollect
that sin will return to the charge, she will renew her solicitations
a thousand and a thousand times; she will sparkle in
your eyes, she will address her honeyed accents to your ears,
she will assume every variety of form, and will deck herself
with a nameless variety of meretricious embellishments and
charms, if haply in some one unguarded moment she may entangle
you in those “fleshly lusts which war against the soul.”
“Count the cost.” Are you prepared to shut your eyes, to
close your ears, and to persist in a firm, everlasting denial?—<i>Robert
Hall.</i></p>

<p>God delights in our temptations, and yet hates them; he delights
in them when they drive us to prayer; he hates them
when they drive us to despair. The Psalm says: “An humble
and contrite heart is an acceptable sacrifice to God,” etc.
Therefore, when it goes well with you, sing and praise God with
a hymn; goes it evil, that is, does temptation come, then pray;
“For the soul has pleasure in him;” and that which follows is
better: “and in them that hope in his goodness.” …
He that feels himself weak in faith, let him always have a desire
to be strong therein, for that is a nourishment which God
relishes in us.</p>

<p>The weak in faith also belong to the kingdom of Christ;
otherwise the Lord would not have said to Peter, “Strengthen
thy brethren,” Luke xxii; and Romans xiv: “Receive the
weak in faith;” also I. Th., v: “Comfort the feeble minded,
support the weak.” If the weak in faith did not belong to
Christ, where, then, would the apostles have been whom the
Lord oftentimes … reproved because of their unbelief?</p>

<p>Upright and faithful Christians ever think they are not faithful,
nor believe as they ought; and therefore they constantly strive,
wrestle, and are diligent to keep and to increase faith, as good
workmen always see that something is wanting in their workmanship.
But the botchers think that nothing is wanting in
what they do, but that everything is well and complete.</p>

<p>Christ desires nothing more of us than that we speak of him.
But thou wilt say, If I speak or preach of him, then the word
freezes upon my lips. O! regard not that, but hear what Christ
says: “Ask and it shall be given unto you,” etc.; and “I am
with him in trouble; I will deliver him and bring him to honor,”
etc.</p>

<p>When we are found true in our vocation and calling, then
have we reaped honor sufficient, though not on this earth, yet
in that to come; there we shall be crowned with the unchangeable
crown of honor “which is laid up for us.” Here
on earth we must seek for no honor, for it is written, “Woe
unto you when men shall bless you.” We belong not to this
life, but to another far better. The world loves that which is
its own; we must content ourselves with that which it bestows
upon us, scoffing, flouting, contempt. I am sometimes glad
that my scholars and friends are pleased to give me such
wages; I desire neither honor nor crown here on earth, but I
will have compensation from God, the just Judge, in heaven.—<i>Luther’s
Table-Talk.</i></p>

<h3>III.—GREEK PRIVATE LIFE.</h3>

<p>While the citizen prized above all things his liberty and his
rights as a member of the state—a feeling which produced in
many cases a citizen democracy—this principle was unknown
within the household, in which he was a despot, ruling absolutely
the inferior members, who had no legal grades except
as distinguished into free and slaves. The laws were very
cautious about interfering with his rights, and he was permitted
to exercise much injustice and cruelty without being punished.
If in such a case he was murdered by his dependants, the
whole household of slaves was put to death, unless the culprit
was detected. Nor could a household exist (except perhaps in
Sparta) without the master. If he died, his widow became
again the ward of her father or eldest brother, or son; and so
strongly was this sometimes felt that men on their deathbeds
betrothed their wives to friends who were likely to treat them
and their orphan children with kindness. Of course clever
women and servants often practically had their own way, and
ruled their lord or master; but the theory of the Greek home
was nevertheless always that of an absolute monarchy, if not
a despotism.</p>

<p>There were two distinct styles of female dress prevalent.
The first was the Dorian, which was noted for its simplicity.
Unmarried girls at Sparta often wore but a single light garment,
<i>chiton</i>,<a href="#greeklife1" id="anch_greeklife1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> fastened with clasps down the sides—a dress
much criticized by their neighbors. Over this was the Doric
<i>peplos</i>,<a href="#greeklife1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> fastened on the shoulders with clasps, and leaving the
arms bare. The Ionians wore a long linen chiton with sleeves,
which reached down to the ground, and over it a large flowing
wrapper, <i>himation</i>,<a href="#greeklife2" id="anch_greeklife2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> fastened with a girdle, worn high or low
according to fashion. As a general rule, unmarried women
confined their hairdressing to mere artistic arrangement of the
hair itself, while married women wore bands, fillets, nets, and
coronets. Dyeing the hair was not uncommon, and the fashionable
color was auburn, or reddish fair hair. Women’s
shoes were very carefully made, and they carried fans and
parasols, as may be seen in the terra-cotta figures so common
in our museums. Both sexes wore rings, but in addition the
women wore earrings, armlets, and ankle-rings, generally of
gold. These were the ornaments against which lawgivers
made enactments, and which were forbidden or discouraged
in days of trouble or poverty. The ornaments of one rich lady
are spoken of as worth 50 minæ (about $975), a very large sum
in those days. The ordinary color of women’s dress was
white, but saffron cloaks, and even flowered patterns, are
mentioned.</p>

<p>In Homeric days we find the old barbarous custom still surviving
of buying a girl from her father for a wife, and this was
commonly done, unless the father himself offered her as a
compliment. The father, however, usually gave her an outfit
from the price he received for her. In case of a separation
this outfit came back to the father, but he was also obliged to
restore the price he had received for his daughter. She does
not appear to have had any legal rights whatever. In later
days the custom of paying money was reversed, and the husband
received with his wife a dowry, which was regarded as
common property with his own, so long as she lived with him.
In case of separation or divorce, this dowry had to be repaid
to her father, and at Athens 18 per cent. was charged upon it
in case of delay in repayment. In many states, to marry a
second wife during the life of the first was against the practice,
and probably the law, of the Greeks, but concubinage was tolerated
and even recognized by them, though a married woman
had at Athens a right to bring an action for general ill-treatment
against her husband, in which she was obliged to appear
and give evidence in person. The dowry seems to have been
partly intended as a useful obstacle to divorce, which required
its repayment, but we find that heiresses made themselves
troublesome by their airs of importance, and this is referred to
in Greek literature, in which men are frequently advised not to
marry above them in wealth or connections. As all citizens
were considered equal in birth, and as marriages with aliens
were illegal and void, we do not hear of advice to young men
not to marry beneath them. To marry a poor citizen girl was
always considered a good deed, and is commended as such.</p>

<p>When a child was born in the house, it was usual in Attica,
and probably elsewhere also, to hang a wreath of olive in case
of a boy, a fillet of wool in case of a girl, over the door. This
served as an announcement to friends and neighbors. Greek
law permitted the parents absolutely to dispose of it as their
property, and there was no provision against exposing it, which
was often done in the case of girls, in order to avoid expense.
These exposed children if found and brought up, became the
slaves of the finder. But on the other hand, the laws showed
special favor to the parents of large families. If a child was
not exposed, there followed on the fifth day a solemn purification
of all the people in the house, and on the seventh a sacrifice,
when the relations assembled and the child was named
generally after parents and grandparents, sometimes by reason
of special wants or fancies—in fact, on the same principles
which we follow in christening our children. There is no evidence
until the later Macedonian times that birthday feasts
were held yearly: and Epicurus’ direction that his should be
kept after his death was thought very peculiar. Children of
rich people were often nursed by hired nurses—an employment
to which respectable Athenian citizens were reduced in
the hard times at the end of the Peloponnesian war. But a
Lacedæmonian nurse was specially valued, and often bought
at a great price among prisoners, as they were famed for bringing
up the child without swaddling-clothes, and making him
hardy and courageous. The Greeks used cradles for children
as we do, and gave them honey as we do sugar, and the nurses
represented on the vases are distinguished by a peculiar kerchief
on the head, as they often are in our day by a cap or
national costume.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the inventive genius of the Greeks
showed itself in the constructing of all manner of toys, and
children devised for themselves perhaps all the games now
known and many more beside. Aristotle says you must provide
them with toys, or they will break things in the house, and
the older philosopher Archytas<a href="#greeklife3" id="anch_greeklife3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was celebrated for inventing
the child’s rattle. Plato also complains of the perpetual roaring
of younger, and the mischievousness of older children.
We may infer from these things that the Greek boys were fully
as troublesome as our own. They had balls, hoops, swings,
hobbyhorses, and dice, with dolls for the girls, and various
animals of wood and earthenware, like the contents of our
Noah’s arks. They played hide and seek, blind man’s buff,
French and English, hunt the slipper, the Italian <i>morra</i>,<a href="#greeklife4" id="anch_greeklife4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
many other games which the scholiasts and Germans have in
vain endeavored to explain. But for grown people, we do not
find many games, properly speaking, played for the game’s
sake, like our cricket. There was very simple ball playing,
and, of course, gambling with dice.</p>

<p>As for the girls of the house, they were brought up to see and
hear as little as possible. They only went out upon a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
state occasions, and knew how to work wool and weave, as
well as to cook. We may fairly infer that the great majority
of them could not read or write. The boys, on the contrary,
were subjected to the most careful education, and on no point
did the Greek lawgivers and philosophers spend more care
than in the proper training, both physical and mental, of their
citizens. The discipline was severe, and they were constantly
watched and repressed, nor were they allowed to frequent the
crowded market-place. Corporal punishment was commonly
applied to them, and the quality most esteemed in boys was a
blushing shyness and modesty, hardly equaled by the girls of
our time. Nevertheless, Plato speaks of the younger boys as
the most sharpwitted, insubordinate, and unmanageable of
animals.</p>

<p>It does not seem that the office of schoolmaster was thought
very honorable, except of course in Sparta, where he was a
sort of minister of education. It was, as with us, a matter of
private speculation, but controlled by police regulations that
the school should open and close with sunrise and sunset and
that no grown men should be allowed to go in and loiter there.
The infant-school teachers, who merely taught children their
letters, were of a low class in society, sometimes even teaching
in the open air, like the old hedge schoolmasters in Ireland.
The more advanced teaching of reading and writing was done
by the grammar teacher, whose house was called, like that of
philosophers and rhetoricians, a school,<a href="#greeklife5" id="anch_greeklife5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a place of leisure.
For the physical and the æsthetic side we have still to mention
the trainer and the teacher of music, the former of whom taught
in the palæstra<a href="#greeklife6" id="anch_greeklife6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the exercises and sports afterward carried on
by the full-grown citizens in the gymnasia, which were a feature
in all Greek towns. The teachers of riper youth stood in
social position above the mere teachers of letters, but beneath
the professors of rhetoric and philosophy (sophists). These
latter performed the functions of college tutors at our universities,
and completed the literary side of Greek education.
The fees paid to the various teachers were in proportion to
their social importance. Some of the sophists made great fortunes,
and exacted very high fees; the mere schoolmasters are
spoken of as receiving a miserable pittance.</p>

<p>The Greeks never thought of making foreign languages a
matter of study, and contented themselves with learning to
read and write their own. In so doing the schoolmasters used
as text books the works of celebrated epic or elegiac poets,
above all Homer, and then the proverbial philosophy of
Hesiod, Solon, Phocylides,<a href="#greeklife7" id="anch_greeklife7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and others, so that the Greek boy
read the great classics of his language at an early age. He
was required to learn much of them by heart,<a href="#greeklife8" id="anch_greeklife8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> especially when
books were scarce; and his teacher pointed out the moral
lessons either professedly or accidentally contained in these
poets. Thus they stood in the place of our Bible and hymns
in education. All this was grammar, which with music and
gymnastics made up the general education of the Greeks. It
excluded the elementary arithmetic of our “three R’s,” and
included what they do not, a gentlemanly cultivation in music
and field sports. It is very doubtful whether swimming was
included, though Herodotus speaks of the Greeks generally as
being able to swim. There is, however, evidence that from
the fourth century B. C. onwards both elementary geometry
and arithmetic, and also drawing, were ordinarily taught.</p>

<p>As regards music, every Greek boy (like modern young
ladies) either had or was supposed to have a musical ear, and
he was accordingly taught either the harp or the flute, and
with it singing. Here again the lyric poems of the greatest
poets were taught him, and the Greek music always laid the
greatest stress on the words. Aristotle and others complain
that amateurs were spending too much time on the practicing
of difficult music, and we know from the musical treatises preserved
to us that the Greeks thought and taught a great deal
more about musical theory and the laws of sound than we do.
The Greek tunes preserved are not pleasing, but we know that
they used the strictest and most subtle principles in tuning instruments,
and understood harmony and discord as well as
we do. Great Athenians, like Cimon, were often able to sing
and accompany themselves on the harp, or lyre as we should
rather call it. The Greeks laid great stress on the moral effects
of music, especially as regards the performer, and were very
severe in their censure of certain styles of music. They distinguished
their scales as <i>modes</i>, and are said to have put far
greater stress on keys than we do, calling some manly and
warlike (Dorian), others weak and effeminate, or even immoral
(Mixo-Lydian). The modern Chinese have the same
beliefs about the moral effects of music. The Greeks had their
keynote in the middle of the scale, and used chiefly the minor
scale of our music. They had different names and signs for
the notes of the various octaves which they used, and also different
signs for vocal and for instrumental music.</p>

<p>Among the various exercises taught were those in fashion at
the public contests in the games—throwing the discus, running,
and wrestling, and those of use in war—throwing the
dart, managing the sword and shield, and riding. Boxing was
not highly esteemed, and seems not to have been properly
understood by the Greeks, who would have had no chance
against an English prize-fighter. The severest contest was the
<i>pancration</i>, where the combatants, who were naked and unarmed,
were allowed to use any violence they liked to overcome
their adversary. It was therefore a combination of
boxing, wrestling and kicking, with occasional biting and
gouging by way of additional resource. We hear of a wonderful
jumping feat by Phayllus of Croton, who leaped forty-four
feet; but as he probably jumped down-hill, and used artificial
aids, we can not be sure that it was more than can be
done now-a-days. The Spartans specially forbade boxing and
the pancration, because the vanquished was obliged to confess
his defeat and feel ashamed; and they did not tolerate professional
trainers. All the special exercises for developing
muscle practiced in our gymnasia seem to have been known,
and they were all practiced naked, as being sunburnt was
highly valued. The Greeks smeared themselves first with oil
and then with sand before their exercises, and cleaned themselves
with a scraper or <i>strigil</i>, or in later days by taking a
bath.</p>

<p>The servants of the house were of course slaves, with the
exception of some field-laborers, and of nurses in times of
depression and distress, when some free women went out for
hire. To these cases we may add the cook, who was not an
inmate of the house before the Macedonian time, but was hired
for the day when wanted for a dinner party. All the rest were
slaves, and were very numerous in every respectable household.
The principal sorts of servants were as follows: There
was a general steward; a butler who had charge of the store-room
and cellar; a marketing slave; a porter; baking and
cooking slaves for preparing the daily meals; an attendant
upon the master in his walks, and this was an indispensable
servant; a nurse, an escort for the children; and a lady’s
maid. In richer houses there was also a groom or mule-boy.
This list shows a subdivision of labor more like the habits of
our East-Indian families than those of ordinary households in
England. If faithful, slaves were often made free, especially
by the will of their master on his death-bed, but they did not
become citizens. They remained in the position of resident
aliens under the patronage of their former master or his representatives.</p>

<p>In proportion as the free population of Greece diminished
the freeing of slaves became more and more common, until it
actually appears to have been the leading feature in the life of
the small towns. Thousands of inscriptions recording this
setting free of individual slaves are still found, and on so many
various stones, even tombstones, that it almost appears as if
material for recording had failed them by reason of the quantity
of these documents. The same increase of liberation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a leading feature in the Roman empire, but there the freedman
obtained the right and position of a citizen, which was not the
case in Greece. The most enlightened moralists of both
countries exhorted benevolence toward slaves, and the frequent
freeing of them as the duty of humane masters, but none
of these writers ever dreamt of the total abolishing of slavery,
which they all held to be an institution ordained by nature.
This seems also the view of the early Christian writers, who
nowhere condemn the principle of slavery as such.</p>

<p>In the oldest times the dead were buried in their own ground,
and close beside the house they had occupied. Afterward the
burying of the dead within the walls of cities was forbidden
except in the case of great public benefactors, who were worshiped
as heroes and had a shrine set over them. The rest
were buried in the fairest and most populous suburb, generally
along both sides of the high road, as at Athens and at Syracuse,
where their tombs and the inscriptions occupied the attention
of everyone that passed by. The oldest and rudest
monuments placed over the tomb were great mounds of earth,
then these mounds came to be surrounded by a circle of great
stones; afterward chambers were cut underground in the earth
or rock, and family vaults established. Handsome monuments
in marble, richly painted and covered with sculpture,
were set up over the spot. These monuments sometimes attained
a size almost as great as a temple. The scenes sculptured
on the marble were from the life and occupation of the
deceased, more often parting scenes, where they were represented
taking leave of their family and friends, nor do we
possess any more beautiful and touching remains of Greek life
than some of these tombs. In the chamber of the dead many
little presents, terra-cotta figures, trinkets and vases were
placed, nay, in early times favorite animals, and even slaves
or captives were sacrificed in order to be with him; for the
Greeks believed that though the parting with the dead was for
ever, he still continued to exist, and to interest himself in human
affairs and in pursuits like those of living men. The
crowded suburbs where the tombs were placed were generally
ornamented with trees and flowers, and were a favorite resort
of the citizens. The dead bodies of executed criminals were
either given back to their relations or, in extreme cases, cast
into a special place, generally some natural ravine or valley
hidden from view and ordinary thoroughfare. Here the executioner
dwelt, who was generally a public slave. This place
was called <i>barathrum</i><a href="#greeklife9" id="anch_greeklife9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
at Athens, and <i>Ceadas</i><a href="#greeklife10" id="anch_greeklife10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> at Sparta.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The earliest and most natural form of idolatry was the worship
of the heavenly bodies, and especially the sun, whose
splendor, light, heat, and salutary influence upon all nature
were regarded as the supernatural and independent powers of a
deity. Hence the ancient myths ascribed personality, and
intelligent activity, to the god of day, whom they worshiped
under the name of Phœbus Apollo. They, however, attached
to the history and worship of Apollo many things not connected
with his original character as the source of light.</p>

<p>Delphi was a principal place of their religious solemnities,
and from an early day the site of a temple dedicated to Apollo.
The first was destroyed by fire; but in the time of the Pisistratidæ
a much more gorgeous one was built, and, through a long
period of their national history, was a center of potent influences
that did much to fashion the character of the people. Its
wealth became immense, and was computed at ten thousand
talents. In the neighborhood of Delphi the Pythian games
were celebrated in the third year of every Olympiad, and in
honor of Apollo’s victory over the terrible Pythian serpent.
On these occasions the celebrated Amphictyonic Council,
whose sessions were usually held at Thermopylæ, met at Delphi,
and the grave senators had the oversight of the games,
prescribed rules for the contestants, and directed in the distribution
of prizes.</p>

<p>The shrine of the god at Delos, his birthplace, was also
greatly renowned. It was situated at the foot of Mount Cynthus,
but the whole island was sacred. The same divinity had
beside a great number of less celebrated temples and shrines,
not only in Greece, but also in Asia Minor, and wherever
Greek colonies were extended. The rites observed in these sacred
places were, in general, more seemly than the ceremonial
of their worship paid to some other of their gods, and may be
counted among the educational forces that improved the social
and political condition of the commonwealth. He granted
them a prophetic dispensation, and the responses given by his
oracles raised their hopes, or, if unfavorable, caused alarm.
The supposed medium of the communications, a priestess, who
ministered at the altar, was esteemed an important personage.
The inspiration, when the conditions were favorable, often induced
what seemed an ecstatic state of mind, bordering on
madness, causing strange contortions of countenance, and incoherent
utterances, understood by none except those who
claimed to be inspired as interpreters, and even their rendering
of the responses was often in enigmas, or terms of such
double meaning as admitted an explanation in accordance
with the events that followed. The convulsions of the priestess
were, perhaps, real, but possibly brought on partly by the chewing
of laurel leaves, and partly by gaseous vapors that issued
from a cleft in the rock, beneath the sacred tripod.</p>

<p>The concept or image of this god Apollo, as expressed by both
poets and artists, was their highest ideal of human excellence
and beauty; a tall, majestic body, of exquisite symmetry, and
having the vigor of immortal youth. Some of his statues, still
extant, are described as marvels of excellence in their line,
and those who can not have access to the originals will find
copies more or less perfect, in almost any considerable collection
having specimens of ancient art. One of the most celebrated
of all ancient statues, on account of the completeness
of the sculptor’s work, is the “Apollo Belvidere.” It was
found at Antium in 1503, purchased, and placed in a part of
the Vatican<a href="#greekmyth1" id="anch_greekmyth1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> called Belvidere. In proportions and altitude it is
a noble figure; naked, or but slightly clad, and in every feature
suggestive of the highest perfection of art. It seems to represent
the great archer just after discharging his arrow at the Python,
and shows his manly satisfaction and assurance of victory.</p>

<p>The legendary history of this god, whose worship was much
celebrated by both Greeks and Romans, recites, among other
things of interest, the memorable circumstances of his friendship
for Hyacinthus, and his great love for Daphne. The
legends will not lose all their interest, though it will be impossible
to print them entire.</p>

<p>Hyacinthus was a beautiful youth of noble parentage, for
whom the great Apollo manifested ardent friendship. He accompanied
him in his sports, led the dogs when he went to
hunt, followed him in his excursions on the mountains, and for
him neglected his lyre and his arrows. As they one day
played quoits together, Apollo heaving aloft the heavy discus,<a href="#greekmyth2" id="anch_greekmyth2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
with his great strength sent it high and far. Hyacinthus
watched its flight through the air, and, excited with the sport
ran to seize it, eager, in turn, to make his throw. Alas! in its
rebound from the earth, it struck him a fatal blow. Apollo,
pale and anxious, sustained the fainting youth, and sought,
in vain, to heal the mortal wound. As some fair lily, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
stalk has been broken, turns its limp flowers toward the earth,
the head of the dying boy, too heavy for its shattered support,
fell over on his shoulder; and the friendly god, lamenting
deeply, said: “O hapless youth! thou diest, robbed of a life
so pleasant, and I the cause. But thou shalt be immortal
still. My lyre shall celebrate our love; and as a beautiful, fragrant
flower, thou shalt dwell with me forever; the inscriptions
on thy leaves<a href="#greekmyth3" id="anch_greekmyth3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> shall proclaim my sorrow.” Even as he spoke
the blood that stained the grass disappeared, and a hyacinth,
of hues more beautiful than Tyrian purple, sprang from the
spot, and shed its sweet fragrance there. “Beloved, though
dead, thou shalt still live; and, with every returning spring
the flowers that henceforth bear thy name shall revive the
memory of thy virtues, and of thy sudden departure to the
home of the immortals.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apollo and Daphne.</span>—The beautiful Daphne (dawn) was
Apollo’s first love. This was nature, if the myth is interpreted
astronomically. The sun pursues the dawn that flees before
his brighter effulgence. But in this love affair, Cupid, as he
is wont, becomes an exciting cause, and with his arrow pierced
the lover’s heart. It was on this wise: Apollo once, exulting
in his own recent victory over the monster Python, saw the
rogue, Cupid, playing with his bow, and called to him saying:
“What have you to do with such warlike weapons? Leave
them for hands more worthy of them, and, child as you are,
do not meddle with my arms.”</p>

<p>The taunting words vexed the son of Venus, and, to avenge
himself he resolved that even the conquering Apollo should
feel the keen point of his little dart, and confess a wound that
would be difficult to heal. So he quickly drew from his quiver
two arrows of different make and metal, one to excite love, the
other to repel it. With the latter, a blunt, leaden shaft, he
struck the nymph Daphne, daughter of the river god Peneus.
The other he thrust through the heart of Apollo, who, thus
smitten, forgot his victories, and was at once seized with passionate
love for the beautiful nymph, while she, delighting in
woodland sports and the pleasures of the chase, had no desire
to leave them. Her father wished to see her wedded, but now,
more than ever, she hated the thought of marriage, and, blushing,
earnestly besought her sire, saying: “Dearest father, grant
me this favor, that I may always remain a maiden, like the
fleet huntress Artemis.”</p>

<p>He consented, but at the same time, in praise of her rare
beauty, said: “Child, your own face will forbid it.” Apollo
dearly loved her and longed to claim her as his own, but his
suit was in vain. She had no love to answer his, and turned
from him. Stung by her indifference, yet enthralled by her
charms, he followed, but her flight was swifter than the wind,
and she delayed not a moment at his entreaties. “Stay,” he
cried, “daughter of Peneus, stay. Do not fly from me as a
lamb from the wolf, or a dove from the hawk. I am not a foe.
For love I pursue thee; and the fear that you may suffer injury
in your rapid flight makes me miserable. You know me not.
I am not a clown to be avoided and despised. Jupiter is my
father, and gives me to know the present and future. They
reverence me at Delphi and Tenedos as the god of prophecy,
of song, and of the lyre. I carry weapons. At the twang of
my bow the arrow flies true to its mark. But Cupid’s darts
have pierced me, and the distress of heart is insupportable. I
know the virtue of all the healing plants, and minister to others,
but myself suffer this malady that no medicine can cure.
Pity, and—” … The nymph continued her flight, and
left his plea half uttered. But even as she fled, her airy robe
and unbound hair flung loose on the wind, she charmed him
yet more. Impatient that his suit did not prevail, he quickened
his speed, and the distance between them grew less.
She eluded his grasp only as a panting hare escapes from the
open jaws of the hound.</p>

<p>So flew Apollo and Daphne; he on wings of love, she on
wings of fear. The very breath of the more powerful pursuer
reaches her delicate person; her strength fails, and, ready to
sink, she cries to her father: “Help me, Peneus! Let the earth
open to receive me, or change my form that has brought me
into this trouble!” She spoke, and, at his will, the metamorphose
was instant. A tender bark enclosed her form; her
limbs became branches, her hair leaves; her feet were rooted
in the ground, and her head became a symmetrical tree top,
graceful to look upon, but retaining nothing of its former self
save its beauty. Apollo stood amazed. He embraced with his
arms the still palpitating, shrinking trunk, and lavished many
kisses on the delicate branches that shrank from his lips.
“You shall, assuredly, be my tree; and I will wear you for my
crown. With you will I decorate my harp and my quiver.
Conquerors shall weave from your branches wreaths to adorn
their brows; and, as immortality is mine, you, too, shall be
always green, and your leaf shall suffer no decay.” The nymph,
thence a beautiful laurel tree, bowed her head in acknowledgment,
and the god was content.</p>

<p>This story of Apollo has been variously interpreted, and is
often alluded to by the poets.</p>

<p>Waller applies it to the case of one whose love songs, though
they did not soften the heart of his mistress, yet won for the
poet widespread fame.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phæton’s Ride.</span>—The ocean nymph Clymene<a href="#greekmyth4" id="anch_greekmyth4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> bore to the
god of day a son, they named Phæton (gleaming). Once
when he boasted his celestial origin Ephaphos, a son of Jupiter,
disputed his claim, alleging that he was puffed up with
pride in a false father. The indignant Phæton reported the
insult to his mother, who, with a solemn oath and imprecation,
reassured him of his heavenly origin, and added: “The land
whence the sun rises lies next to ours; go and inquire for yourself.
See if he will not own you as his son.” The youth heard
with delight, and full of pride and hope hastened to the palace
of his sire, who received him kindly, and from whom he obtained
an unwary oath that, in proof of his fatherhood, he
would grant him whatever he asked. The ambitious Phæton
immediately demanded permission to prove his pedigree, and
confound his adversary, by taking his father’s seat, with leave,
for one day, to guide the solar chariot in its course through
the heavens. Phœbus, aware of the danger of any such attempt,
would gladly have recalled his word, and persuaded the
rash youth from his wild purpose. “This, my son, is far too
perilous an undertaking, and quite unsuited to thy powers.
These fiery horses would despise the guidance of Jupiter himself,
were he to take the reins; how, then, can a mortal hand restrain
them? Thou knowest not the perils of the way. In the
freshness of the early morning the panting coursers scarce can
climb that steep ascent; at noonday the downward glance to
the far rolling sea, and the green earth lying at so vast a depth
is hazardous even for a god. Canst thou, then, yet so young,
resist the rapid movement of the whirling heavens, or endure
the blinding brilliancy of those flaming orbs? That monstrous
‘Lion,’ the ‘Scorpion,’ and the ‘Crab,’ will surely terrify thee.
The famed ‘Archer’ and the raging ‘Bear’ will threaten destruction.
In the later hours the course descends rapidly, and
requires most steady driving. Any charioteer, unused to the
road, and the team, would be plunged headlong, or, deviating
from the course, be swept away by the force that bears all else
along, swift as the lightning. Forego that rash design. Look
now on what the world contains, and ask some other boon.
Ask it, and fear no refusal. Yet you shall have this, if you
persist. The oath was sworn, and must be kept. Will you not
be advised, and choose more wisely?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But the self-confident youth, heedless of his father’s counsel,
and despising the warning, would, at any risk, gratify his
foolish ambition. He demanded the immediate fulfillment of
the promise, and prevailed.</p>

<p>And now the purple gates of the East were unfolded, and
from within the palace there breathed celestial fragrance.
The stars and waning moon gradually disappeared; and, at
Phœbus’ command, the swift Hours led forth from their stalls
the prancing steeds and attached them to the golden chariot,
their harness sparkling with gems, and the yoke gleaming all
over with diamonds of exceeding brilliance. The daring youth
gazed in admiration too eager for the coveted pleasure.
Phœbus bathed his face with a powerful unguent that made
him capable of enduring awhile the terrible heat, and placing
a radiant circlet on his brow, that made him seem the very god
of light, gave such instructions as were necessary. “Spare
the whip, and hold tight the reins; my steeds need no urging;
the labor is to guide and hold them in; you are not to take
what seems the direct road, but turn off to the left; keep within
the middle zone, that the skies and the earth may each receive
their due share of light and heat; go not too high, lest
you burn the dwellings of Ouranos; nor yet too low, or you
will set the earth on fire; the middle course is safest and best;
night is passing through the western gates, and the chariot can
delay no longer; go, if you must, but, if you will, tarry in safety
where you are, and allow me, as I have been wont, to light
and heat the world.” The too eager youth, hearing but little,
sprang to the lofty seat, grasped the reins with boundless delight,
standing erect, and pouring out thanks for his opportunity.</p>

<p>The snorting horses, impatient to be gone, and with the
boundless plain of heaven stretching out before them, dart forward
cleaving the clouds, and quite outrun the swiftest winds
that started from the same goal. The load was much lighter
than usual, and, as a ship, without freight or ballast, “is
tossed hither and thither on the sea, so that vast chariot, without
its accustomed weight, was dashed about in space, as if
utterly empty.” Phæton was incompetent to guide the fiery
steeds, now quite out of the prescribed course, and was overcome
with terror. Whither he was borne, at such furious
speed, he knew not, but he was evidently in the midst of the
most appalling dangers, against which he had been warned in
vain. Paleness and sudden trembling came over him, and
bitterly, but too late, repenting his folly, he wished he had
never seen the gorgeous palace of Phœbus, known the truth of
his parentage, or touched his father’s horses.</p>

<p>On every side were strange, frightful objects menacing his
destruction, and he was driven fiercely about among them, as
a ship before a tempest when the pilot can do nothing. The
reins drop from his nerveless hands, and the furious horses
dash the quivering, rocking chariot through untraveled
regions of space. The heavens were all in flames, the clouds
were smoke, and far beneath them lay a burning world. The
mountain tops, forests, harvest fields, and cities were becoming
involved in the common ruin. The <i>earth</i>, stretching out
suppliant hands toward heaven, implored the help of Jupiter
lest the universe should be destroyed, and chaos again prevail.
“Save what yet remains before all is lost. O, take
thought for our deliverance in this fearful crisis.”</p>

<p>The appeal was answered, and the king of gods summoned
his forked lightnings, and hurled his thunderbolt that smote
the affrighted charioteer, who now, himself on fire, fell like
some shooting star that marks its course to earth with its
winding sheet of flame. Eridanus,<a href="#greekmyth5" id="anch_greekmyth5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the great river, received
the charred body and quenched the flame that would have
consumed it. The pitying Naiads gave him a tomb, and
some one provided the epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Driver of Phœbus’ chariot, Phæton,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Struck by Jove’s thunder, rests beneath this stone;</div>
<div class="verse i1">He could not rule his father’s car of fire;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Yet was it much, so nobly to aspire.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His sisters, the Heliades,<a href="#greekmyth6" id="anch_greekmyth6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> so long and sadly mourned their
brother that the gods changed them into poplar trees, whose
tender branches shed tears of precious amber, which, hardening
in the water where they fell, became jewels that were
greatly prized, and worn as ornaments.</p>

<p>The world has known many whose foolish pride and ambition
destroyed them. A recent writer quotes the last verse
from one of Prior’s familiar poems, on a female Phæton, and
thus introduces it: “Kitty has been imploring her mother to
allow her to go out into the world, as her friends have done, if
only for once.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poseidon (Neptune) and Amphitrite.</span><a href="#greekmyth7" id="anch_greekmyth7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—This son of
Cronos and Rhea became, by allotment, ruler of the sea, and
received a three-pronged trident as the emblem of his power.
Amphitrite, one of the daughters of Nereus, was his queen;
and their gorgeous palace was in the deep waters of the
Ægean, off the shores of Eubœa. Some accounts represent
him as dwelling less permanently in the deep places than
father Nereus, “the old man of the sea.” But, when abroad
attending the councils of his brothers on Olympus, or out on
the vast plain of the deep, passing swiftly in his boat over the
rolling billows, he had under his supreme control the world
of waters, and all the forces that affect their movements.
When he strikes the calm sea with his trident<a href="#greekmyth8" id="anch_greekmyth8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the waves rise
in their violence to swallow up or dash in pieces the ships and
strew with wrecks the shore. But a word or look from him
can allay the wildest tempest, and still the tumult of the
waters.</p>

<p>For reasons not very apparent, the horse is often mentioned
as his favorite animal, and was said to be his gift to men.
Possibly it was because the lively imagination of the ancient
Greek saw, in the white crested waves that pursued each other
in wild commotion, the rearing and bounding of foaming
steeds or war-horses, that dash over the plain with resistless
force. And his own car they imagined drawn over the waters
by coursers swifter than the wind.</p>

<p>Poseidon was especially regarded as their patron and tutelar
deity by all seafaring classes, such as fishermen, boatmen,
and sailors. When going to sea they addressed prayers to
him, and when returning in safety, offered sacrifices in gratitude
for their escape from the perils of the deep. His temples,
altars and statues were most numerous in seaport
towns, on islands, and peninsulas. One much frequented was
at Corinth, and there games were celebrated in honor of
Poseidon.</p>

<p>Some of the principal exploits ascribed to Neptune are the
assistance he rendered Jupiter against the Titans; the raising
of the island Delos out of the sea; the creation and taming of
the horse; and the building of the walls and ramparts of Troy.
He was feared also as the author of earthquakes and deluges,
which he caused or checked, at his pleasure.</p>

<p>To him they ascribed a numerous progeny. The principal
sons were Triton, Phorcus, Proteus, and Glaucus. The chief
characteristics of these minor deities of the sea were the power
of divination, and ability to change their forms at pleasure.
All these, with the sea-nymphs, fifty in number, belonged to
the train of Neptune, and were subservient to his will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hephaistos (Vulcan).</span>—The fire god, according to Homer,
was son of Jupiter and the queenly Juno; or, according to
another account of Juno alone, the goddess being jealous over
the manner of Minerva’s birth from the cleft-skull of her
spouse. The little Vulcan was so ill-looking and lame that
the proud mother thought to cast him out of their palace, disowned.
But though so cruelly treated he always showed some
regard for her, and once took her part in a quarrel she had
with the king. Jupiter, enraged at this, caught him by the
foot and hurled him from the awful height of Olympus. He
was a whole day falling, but in the evening alighted on the
island Lemnos,<a href="#greekmyth9" id="anch_greekmyth9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> where he was kindly received and nourished
for years in a deep grotto of the sea, by Eurymone<a href="#greekmyth10" id="anch_greekmyth10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Thetis,
and afterward, in return for their kindness, he made
them many ornaments. Later mythical writers mention
his lameness as a consequence of that fall. But Homer,
whose authority we follow, represents him as lame from his
birth.</p>

<p>Milton, in his “Paradise Lost,” evidently alludes to this
Grecian myth, though he makes a different application of it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i12">“From morn</div>
<div class="verse">To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,</div>
<div class="verse">A summer’s day; and, with the setting sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,</div>
<div class="verse">On Lemnos, the Ægean isle.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When or how he was restored to Olympus we are not informed,
nor whether the time required for the ascent equaled
or exceeded that of the fall. Enough, that his presence and
useful offices there are subsequently recognized. He may
have become mediator between his parents; and at times humorously
assumed the role of cup-bearer at the feasts of the
Olympians, causing them much merriment as he busily hobbled
from one to another presenting the cups of nectar.<a href="#greekmyth11" id="anch_greekmyth11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that their first conception of Hephaistos was
that of the god of fire, simply. But as fire is the efficient agent
employed in smelting and working metals, he was afterward,
and very naturally, regarded as the inventor of furnaces,
foundries and forges, including all workshops where skillful artisans
wrought in iron and the other metals. With his workmen
of skill and Cyclopic strength he constructed all the shining
palaces for the immortals on Olympus, and also his own
immense workshop with the huge anvils and “twenty bellows”
that, at his bidding, worked automatically. He designed and
executed numberless articles, both useful and ornamental,
suitable for the abodes of either gods or men; and some of
their mythical poems and stories are enriched with descriptions
of the exquisite workmanship they display. Later accounts
mention his workshop as no longer on Olympus, but on
some volcanic island where his forges glow with heat and his
workmen are equal to any demands made on their skill or
strength. Hephaistos, like Athena, gave skill to mortal artisans,
and they too were believed to have taught men all things
suitable to embellish or adorn their habitations.</p>

<p>In statuary, during the best period of old Grecian art, he is
represented as a vigorous, bearded man of muscular frame,
and is characterized by the presence of his hammer or some
other instrument, and the corselet which leaves the strong,
right arm and shoulder uncovered.</p>

<p>The Romans not only changed the name to Vulcan, but
regarded Ætna as his glowing forge, and Venus as his
wife; thus expressing the idea that art and beauty are in harmony.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.—PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE POISON HABIT.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Stimulant Vice is the principal cause of human degeneration.”—<i>Haller.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Science tells us that there is a general progressive tendency
in nature. According to the opinion of some modern biologists,
all plants and animals have been developed from lower
and less perfect organisms, and still continue their upward
progress. We may reject that view, or accept it with considerable
modifications; but one thing remains certain: Nature
does not go backward of her own accord. Wherever the harmony
of creation has not been wilfully disturbed the trees are
as tall as of yore, the fruits as sweet and the flowers as fragrant.
The eagle soars as high as ever, the song-thrush has
not forgotten her anthems, nor the swallow her swift flight, the
ostrich still scorneth the horse and his rider, it still requires a
Samson to rend a young lion. How, then, can it be explained
that the noblest work of Nature makes a sad exception to that
rule? How is it that man alone is sinking in misery and disease,
growing weaklier and sicklier from century to century,
from generation to generation? War has not dealt us those
wounds, famine and pestilence can not explain our “ailments
and pains, in form, variety and degree beyond description.”
The influence of all transient causes of evil is counteracted by
the healing agencies of Nature. See the children of the wilderness,
how soon they recover from hurts and wounds, how
completely from the effects of protracted starvation, their off-spring
as sound as their ancestors in Eden. No, the cause of
our degeneracy must be a permanently active cause, and with
the assurance of a clear and perfect conviction we can say:
That restless enemy of human health and happiness is the
poison vice.</p>

<p>Without the redeeming influence of nature, the balm of sleep
and the regenesis<a href="#temperance1" id="anch_temperance1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of every new birth, alcohol alone would
have effected the destruction of the human race. During the
gradual development of the vice the adaptive faculties of the
human system have somewhat modified its influence, but its
real significance reveals itself when its flood-gates are suddenly
opened upon an <i>unprepared</i> race. In Siberia, in Polynesia,
and among the aborigines of our own continent, the
alcohol plague has raged with the destructiveness of the black
death;<a href="#temperance2" id="anch_temperance2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> wigwams, villages, nay, entire districts have been depopulated
in the course of a single generation. Among the
Caucasian<a href="#temperance3" id="anch_temperance3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> nations, where the vice has gradually progressed
from half-fermented must to brandy, its baneful effects are less
sudden, but not less certain. From age to age the form
created in the image of God has decayed, has shrunk like a
building collapsing under the progress of a devouring fire.
Wherever intemperance has increased, manhood and strength
have decreased. The Anacreons<a href="#temperance4" id="anch_temperance4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of antiquity indulged in
wine only at occasional festivals. The peasants of the Middle
Ages were generally too poor to use intoxicating drinks of any
kind. But by and by wages improved. Strong ale and brandy
were added to the home-brewed beverages of the working
classes. Habitual stimulation, once the ruin of the idle aristocrat,
became the curse of the masses. The <i>poison marasmus</i><a href="#temperance5" id="anch_temperance5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
became a pandemic<a href="#temperance6" id="anch_temperance6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> plague. The yeomen of ancient
England would not recognize their gin drinking descendants;
a Norman Knight could have crushed a Stockholm dandy with
a single grip of his fist. Challenge the apostles of lager beer,
take them to Nuremberg, to the armory of the old City Hall,
let them pick their champion from the ranks of the bloated
and sickly looking citizens, defy them to find a single man
able to wield the weapons that were toys in the hands of the
old burghers. Or the advocates of “good, cheap, country wine”—take
them to Spain and let them see what the best wine has
done for the manliest race on earth. The inhabitants of Castile,
of Aragon, Valencia, Barcelona and Leon are the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the old Visigoths,<a href="#temperance7" id="anch_temperance7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a race of rude warriors who overpowered
the disciplined legions of Rome as easily as the Romans would
have quelled a rabble of African rebels. Gibbon describes
their first encounter with the Roman armies, how the imperial
general invited the Gothic chieftains to a banquet, where he
intended to assassinate their guards and attack their camps
during the confusion, and how the Goths were saved by the
intrepidity of their leaders: “At these words, Fritigern<a href="#temperance8" id="anch_temperance8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
his companions drew their swords, opened their passage
through the unresisting crowd, and, mounting their horses,
hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans.
The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful
acclamations of the camp; war was instantly resolved, the
banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom
of their ancestors, and the air resounded with the march signals
of the barbarian trumpet.” No painter’s magic could
more vividly evoke the forms of that giant race, their chieftains
making their way through a crowd of shrinking cowards,
the tumult of the camp, and the iron-fisted warriors, receiving
their leaders with exultant shouts! And those men were the
ancestors of the modern Spaniards—lions shrunk into cats,
eagles into mousing hawks! It is idle sophistry to ascribe that
result to climatic influences. In a warmer climate than Spain
the abstemious Arabs, the Afghans, and the Moors have preserved
the vigor of their earliest ancestors. The soil that now
produces <i>lazzaroni</i><a href="#temperance9" id="anch_temperance9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and <i>musici</i><a href="#temperance10" id="anch_temperance10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was once trod by the conquerors
of three continents. In the snow-bound wigwams of
the North American Indians a cold climate has not prevented
the ravages of the alcohol plague. Poison has filled more
graves than the sword, more than famine, and the plague and
all the hostile powers of Nature taken together. The poison
vice has shortened our average longevity by twenty years,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
has turned athletes into cripples, giants into dwarfs.</p>

<p>Yet that result does not prove the vindictiveness of Nature;
but her patience, the infinite patience that has prevented our
utter self-destruction by mitigating the consequences of our
suicidal follies. At night, while the drunkard sleeps his torpor
sleep, the hand of our All-mother cools his fevered brow,
the subtle alchemy of the organism allays the effects of the
poison while the system performs at least a portion of its vital
functions; in every child the influence of ancestral sins is
modified by the tendency of redeeming instincts. If it were
not for the restless activity of those remedial influences, fire-water
alone would have caused more havoc than the deluge.
From a pessimistic point of view the study of the physical effects
of the poison vice might almost justify the conjecture of
the biologist Hoffmann. “Nature,” says he, “has set limits to the
over increase of every species of animals. Insects prey upon
smaller insects, minnows upon midges, trouts upon minnows,
pikes upon trouts, the fish-otter upon pikes, and man himself
upon the fish-otter. Man himself has no earthly rival, but
Providence (<i>die Vorsehung</i>) has met that difficulty by making
him a self-destructive animal!”</p>

<p>If that shocking idea were not at variance with other facts,
one might, indeed, admire the ingenious adaptation of means
to ends, for if it were the intention of God to limit our prosperity
and afflict us with every possible evil short of absolute annihilation,
he could certainly not have chosen a more efficient
agent than alcohol.</p>

<p>Alcohol, the rectified product of the vinous fermentation
(<i>i. e.</i>, decomposition) of various saccharine fluids, and included
by chemists among the narcotic poisons, exercises a metamorphosic
effect on every organ of the human body; and no
fact in physiology is more incontestably established than that
all its <i>appreciable</i> effects are deleterious ones. The advocates
of alcohol base their claims upon vague theories. The opponents
of alcohol base their claims upon obvious facts. It has
been asserted that alcohol protects the system against cold,
but the exponents of that theory have failed to show how the
constituent elements of alcohol can take the place of the natural
heat producers, the non-nitrogenous foods; they have also
failed to explain a fact established by the unanimous testimony
of polar travelers, namely, that a low temperature can
be longer and more easily endured by total abstainers than by
those who indulge in <i>any kind</i> of alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p>Alcohol has been called a “negative food,” because it retards
the progress of the organic changes; but it has been
demonstrated that that retardation is in every case an abnormal
and morbid process, and that its results can not benefit
the system in any appreciable way, while its deleterious effects
are seen in the fatty degeneration of the tissues, the impoverished
condition of the blood, and many other symptoms characterizing
the influence of insufficient nutrition. Alcohol has
been called a positive food, because, forsooth, it is derived (by
a process of decomposition) from grain, fruits and other nutritive
substances. We might as well call mildew a nutritive
substance because it is formed by the decay of wholesome
food. “There is no more evidence,” says Dr. Parker, “of alcohol
being in any way utilized in the body, than there is in
regard to ether or chloroform. If alcohol is to be still designated
as <i>food</i>, we must extend the meaning of that term so as
to make it comprehend not only chloroform, but all medicines
and poisons—in fact, everything which can be swallowed and
absorbed, however foreign it may be to the normal condition
of the body, and however injurious to its functions. On the
other hand, from no definition that can be framed of a <i>poison</i>,
which should include those more powerful anæsthetic agents,
whose poisonous character has been unfortunately too clearly
manifested in a great number of instances, can alcohol be
fairly shut out.”</p>

<p>The antiseptic influence of alcohol was long supposed to constitute
a safeguard against malarial diseases, but it has been
found that the prophylactic<a href="#temperance11" id="anch_temperance11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> effect of distilled liquors is confined
to the period of actual stimulation (the alcohol fever), and
that in the long run abstinence is from eight to ten times more
prophylactic than dram drinking.</p>

<p>Alcohol has been mistaken for an invigorating tonic; but
we have seen that the supposed process of invigoration is a
process of stimulation, or rather of irritation, and that we might
as well try to “invigorate” a weary traveler by drenching him
with <i>aqua fortis</i>.<a href="#temperance12" id="anch_temperance12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it has been proved by ocular demonstration
that alcoholic liquids, applied to the living tissue, induce
redness and inflammation, and cover the mucous lining of the
stomach with ulcerous patches; that they change the structure
of the liver, stud it with tubercles and disqualify it for its
proper functions, though by obstructing its vascular ducts they
often swell it to twice, and sometimes to five times, its natural
size. The weight of a healthy liver varies from five to eight
pounds, and Dr. Youmans mentions the post mortem examination
of an English drunkard whose liver was found to weigh
<i>fifty pounds</i>, and adds that in spite of this enormous enlargement
of the bile-secreting organ, the man died from a deficiency
of bile. The records of the Parisian charity hospitals have
established the fact that the moderate use of alcoholic drinks
during a period of five years is sufficient to permeate the substance
of the liver with fatty infiltrations, and that the liver of
old drunkards undergoes changes which make it practically a
lump of inert matter, a mass of compacted tubercles and scirrhous<a href="#temperance13" id="anch_temperance13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
ulcers. Even in the advanced stages of the disorder a
large dose of concentrated alcohol rouses the diseased organ
into a sort of feverish activity which, however, soon subsides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
into a deeper and more incurable torpor. Hence the temporary
efficacy and ultimate uselessness (to say the least) of alcoholic
“liver regulators.”</p>

<p>It has also been proved that alcohol inflames the brain, obstructs
the kidneys, impoverishes the blood, and impairs the
functional vigor of the respiratory organs.</p>

<p>The infallible necessity of all these results can be more fully
realized by a clear comprehension of the proximate causes,
which may be summed up in a few words: While the organism
has to waste its strength on the elimination of the poison, it
must neglect its normal functions, or perform them in a hasty,
perfunctory way. Let me illustrate the matter by an apologue.<a href="#temperance14" id="anch_temperance14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
A family of poor tenants occupy a cottage at the edge of the
woods. They are honest, hard-working people, trying their
best to live within their means, but at a certain hour they are
every day attacked by a bear. Before the good man can mend
his jacket, before the good wife has cooked her dinner, before
the boys have finished their spelling lesson, they have to rally
and fight that brute. Sometimes the bear comes twice a day.
They generally manage to hustle him out of the premises, but
if they return to their cottage the father’s jacket is torn into
shreds, the dinner is burned, and in the excitement of the row
the boys have forgotten their lesson. Their clothes are torn,
their hands and faces bear the marks of the scrimmage, the
whole household is in a state of the wildest disorder. The
poor people go to work and try to repair the mischief the best
way they can, but before they have finished the job the bear
comes back, and another rumpus turns the house upside down.
No wonder that things go from bad to worse, no wonder the
tenants can not pay their rent; but a very considerable wonder
that the landlord does not relieve them by killing that
bear.</p>

<p>The manliest races of the present world are probably the Lesghian<a href="#temperance15" id="anch_temperance15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and Daghistan<a href="#temperance16" id="anch_temperance16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> mountaineers, who inhabit the southern
highlands of the Caucasus,<a href="#temperance17" id="anch_temperance17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and who defied the power of the
Russian empire for sixty-five years. From 1792 to 1858, army
after army of schnapps drinking<a href="#temperance18" id="anch_temperance18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Muscovites<a href="#temperance19" id="anch_temperance19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> attacked them
from the north, east and west, and were hurled back like dogs
from the lair of a lion, and <i>fifteen hundred thousand</i> Russian
soldiers perished in the Caucasian defiles before the Russian
eagles supplanted the crescent of Daghistan. For the heroic
highlanders are Mohammedans, and <i>total abstainers from intoxicating
drinks</i>. The Ossetes,<a href="#temperance20" id="anch_temperance20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who inhabit the foothills of
the northern range, are addicted to the use of <i>slibovits</i><a href="#temperance21" id="anch_temperance21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> (peach
brandy) and other stimulants, and their bloated faces present
a striking contrast to the clean-cut features of the tribes who
have been chosen as the representatives of the white race.
They are as stubborn as their southern neighbors, but not as
enterprising; as self-sacrificing in the defense of their country,
but not as self-reliant. In spite of their healthy climate they
are cachectic<a href="#temperance22" id="anch_temperance22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and rather dull witted; alcohol has stunted
their stamina as well as their stature.</p>

<p>But there are other forms of physical degeneration which
can with certainty be ascribed to the influence of the secondary
stimulants, tobacco, tea, coffee, and pungent spices. Tobacco
makes the Turks indolent, tea and coffee make us nervous
and dyspeptic; and the worst is that those minor vices
pave the way to ruin; a constitution enfeebled by theïne poison<a href="#temperance23" id="anch_temperance23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
is less able to resist the influence of fusel poison. It is a
great mistake to suppose that abstinence from concentrated
alcoholic liquors could atone for the habitual use of other
stimulants. The vices of our ancestors were gross, but one-sided;
ours are more manifold, and in their effects more comprehensive.
In France many so-called temperate drinkers
indulge in light wine, absinthe, tea, coffee and chloral, and are
weaklier and sicklier than the Hungarian dram drinkers who
confine themselves to plum brandy, for the system of the miscellaneous
poison-monger has to defend itself against five enemies,
and, as it were, sustain the wounds of five different
weapons. The mediæval knights and many Grecian and Roman
epicureans could drink a quantity of wine that would kill
a modern toper; but they confined themselves to that one
stimulant, and showed sense enough to keep it from their boys,
who had a chance to fortify their constitutions with gymnastics
before they endangered them with alcohol, and not rarely
thus fortified their mental constitutions to a degree that made
them temptation proof. Pythagoras and Mohammed interdicted
wine, and that statute did not interfere with the propagation
of their doctrines, for voluntary abstainers were by no
means rare—before the introduction of secondary stimulants.
We fuddle our schoolboys with coffee and cider, and it is a
curious and very frequent consequence of that early development
of the stimulant habit that its victim forgets the happiness
of his childhood and accepts daily headaches and chronic
nightmares as some of the “ills that flesh is heir to.” Rousseau
believed that a man would be safe against the poison
vice if he could reach his twentieth year without contracting
the habit, because in the meantime observation would have
taught him the effects of intemperance. But his safety would be
guaranteed by another circumstance. He would know what
health means, and no deference to established customs would
tempt him to exchange freedom for chains.</p>

<p>But a still greater mistake is the idea that drunkenness could
be abated by the introduction of milder alcoholic drinks. We
can not fight rum with lager beer. All poison habits are progressive,
and we have seen that the beer vice is always apt to
eventuate in a brandy vice, or else to equalize the difference
by a progressive enlargement of the dose. Common brandy
contains fifty per cent. of alcohol, lager beer about ten; so, if
A. drinks one glass of brandy and B. five glasses of beer they
have outraged their systems by the same amount of poison
and will incur the same penalty. Total abstinence is the safe
plan, nay, the only safe plan, for poisons can not be reduced
to a harmless dose. By diminishing the quantities of the stimulant
we certainly diminish its power for mischief, but as long
as the dose is large enough to produce any appreciable effect
that effect is a deleterious one.</p>

<p>Various diseases and that artificial disorder called intoxication
react on certain faculties of the mind (by affecting their corresponding
cerebral organ) as regularly as on the liver or any
other part of the human organism. Consumption stimulates
the love of life: a self-deluding hope of recovery characterizes
the advanced stage of the disease as invariably as the hectic
flush that simulates the color of health. Hasheesh excites combativeness.
Alcohol first excites and gradually impairs <i>self-reliance</i>,
and thus undermines the basis of truthfulness, of private
and social enterprise, of manly courage and generosity.
Moral cowardice, the chief reproach of our generation, has
more to do with the tyranny of the poison vice than with the
despotism of social prejudices. The brain stimulating effect
of alcohol decreases with every repetition of the dose, and Dr.
Theodore Chambers warns us that “however long the evil
results of such habitual overtasking may be postponed, they
are sure to manifest themselves at last in <i>that general breakdown
which is the necessary sequence of a long continued excess
of expenditure over income</i>.”</p>

<p>Besides, even the temporary results would not justify that
expenditure. “Brain workers should confine themselves to
<i>metaphysical tonics</i>,” says Dr. Bouchardat<a href="#temperance24" id="anch_temperance24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; “alcoholic drinks,
at any rate, are unavailable for that purpose. Even after a
single glass of champagne I have found that the slight mental
exaltation is accompanied by a slight obfuscation.<a href="#temperance25" id="anch_temperance25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The mind
soars, but it soars into the clouds.” “Wine stirs the brain,”
says the poet Chamisso, “but not its higher faculties as much
as the sediments that muddle it.”</p>

<p>The Arabs have a tradition that soon after the flood, when
Nunus (the Arabian Noah) had resumed his agricultural pursuits,
a <i>Ghin</i>, or spirit, appeared to him and taught him the
art of manufacturing wine from grape-juice. “This beverage,
O son of an earthly father,” said the <i>Ghin</i>, “is a liquid of peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
properties. The first bumperful will make you as tame
as a sheep. If you repeat the experiment you will become
as fierce as a rampant lion. After the third dose you will roll
in the mud like a hog.” If the <i>Ghin</i> had been a spirit of epigrammatic
abilities he might have summarized his remarks:
“The effects of this liquid, O Nunus, vary, of course, with the
amount of the dose. But if you drink it you will infallibly
make a beast of yourself.”</p>

<p>In the long list of artificial stimulants, with all their modifications
and compounds, there is no such thing as a harmless
tonic. Alcohol, especially, is in all its disguises, the most implacable
enemy of the human organism. In large quantities
it is a lethal<a href="#temperance26" id="anch_temperance26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> poison; in smaller doses its effects are less deadly
but not less certainly injurious, and the advocates of moderate
drinking might as well recommend moderate perjury. Our lager
beer enthusiasts might just as well advise us to introduce a
milder brand of rattlesnakes. The alcohol habit in all its forms
and in every stage of its development, is a degrading vice.</p>

<h3>III. BARLEY, OATS, RICE AND BUCKWHEAT.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BYRON D. HALSTED, SC. D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><span class="smcap">Barley</span> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i><a href="#kitchen1" id="anch_kitchen1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) is thought by some historians to
be the oldest of the cultivated grains. Professor Brewer says it
was the chief bread plant of the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and
Romans. There are several varieties, the principal ones being
the two-rowed and the six-rowed. Like wheat and rye, barley is
both a spring and winter grain; though with us the seed is
usually sown in the spring.</p>

<p>Barley is the most hardy cereal, and may be successfully
cultivated over the widest range of climate. It is grown in
central Siberia, northern Russia, and in Lapland to latitude
70°. At the opposite extreme, barley flourishes in semi-tropical
countries. In 1880 the area of barley in the United States
was 1,997,717 acres, with a yield of 44,113,495 bushels. The
average yield, therefore, is not far from twenty-five bushels
per acre. Though adapted for a wide range of growth, its cultivation
is principally confined to a few states, the leading
ones of which are California, with twelve and a half million
bushels; New York, seven and two-thirds millions; Wisconsin,
five million; Iowa, four millions; and Minnesota, three millions
bushels. It will be seen by comparing these figures with
the total above given that California and New York produce
nearly one half (46 per cent.) of all the barley grown in this
country. These two states are very unlike in soil, climate, etc.
In California the conditions are not favorable for the growth of
oats and corn, and for similar reasons barley is the leading
grain in Nevada and Arizona. The cultivation of this crop in
New York and other eastern states has been stimulated by the
great demand for the grain in the manufacture of beer. It has
proved more profitable than wheat in many localities, especially
where the latter grain has been infested with the Hessian
fly. It is interesting to note that Pennsylvania produces less
than half a million bushels, or not over one eighth as much as
New York. This only shows, as is abundantly illustrated in
many other cases, that market, soil and climate may have
everything to do with the area devoted to any particular crop.</p>

<p>Barley was largely grown by the early settlers of New England,
who used the grain for making bread, but for this purpose
corn supplanted it in later years, it being better fitted for
table dishes. Barley forms an important food for domestic
animals, the greater part of the immense quantities grown on
the Pacific coast being used for this purpose. Professor Brewer
says: “Only a very insignificant quantity is used for food in this
country; less than of any other cereal.” “Pearled barley” is
the grain with the outer hull removed, and in this condition it
is used to a considerable extent in soups and in other foods.
The following is the chemical composition of barley, pearled
barley and barley meal:</p>

<p>The chemical constituents of barley do not vary greatly from
those of wheat. There is more ash and fiber because the hull
is thicker. It is seen that the per cent. of these two constituents
is much reduced in the analysis of the pearled barley, in
which the outer covering is removed. We here have a demonstration
of the fact that the starchy matters are more abundant
in the central part of the grain, while the albuminoids, ash,
fiber, and fat abound near the surface. Barley, when ground
into meal, makes a rich feed for live stock.</p>

<p>The chief use now made of barley grown in the eastern
states is in the making of beer. Barley has been employed for
this purpose from very early times. The old Egyptians made
beer, and the ancient Greeks and Romans were acquainted
with its manufacture, as well as with its effects upon the human
system. The process is as follows: First soak the grain
in water, and then allow it to germinate or sprout. Chemical
changes take place in the starchy materials of the grain, by
which they become soluble in water. After the sprouting has
advanced far enough the grain is heated and dried, when the
product is called malt. This malt, or kiln-dried sprouted grain
is ground or crushed between rollers, and placed in mash tubs
with warm water. During this gradual heating the changed
starch is dissolved by the water. After the infusion settles the
clear liquid is drawn off and boiled in a vessel with hops. The
boiling liquid is strained, cooled, and run into the fermentation
vats, where yeast is added. During the fermentation a part
of the sugar derived from the starch is converted into alcohol.
After a refining process the beer is ready to go into the casks.
Ale, Scotch ale, small beer, porter, stout, and lager beer are
the malt products of barley. The amount of capital now invested
in the manufacture of beer is very great, and to those
who carefully measure the evils of the beer shop it seems like
a very poor place for one’s money.</p>

<p>Barley is imported in large quantities from Canada, in 1880
the amount being over seven million bushels, chiefly for malting.
Enormous quantities are imported by Great Britain from
several countries, the leading being Turkey, France, Germany
and Russia. Professor Brewer says: “The cultivation of barley
is doubtless on the increase, and there are many reasons,
too, for the belief that its production in America will very
greatly increase during the present century.”</p>

<p>The enemies of barley are nearly the same as those of wheat.
It is more free from rust and smut, and less liable to be attacked
by insects. The crop, though disagreeable to harvest,
owing to the penetrating beards and poisonous effects to many
who handle the straw, is a comparatively sure one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oats</span> (<i>Avena sativa</i><a href="#kitchen2" id="anch_kitchen2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) rank third in importance among the
grains grown in the United States. The native country of the
oat is not certainly known. “It was cultivated by the prehistoric
inhabitants of Central Europe and is found in the remains
of the lake habitations<a href="#kitchen3" id="anch_kitchen3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in Switzerland.” In Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
oats have long been a leading crop for human food, and in
compiling his dictionary, Dr. Johnson took occasion to fling a
sarcasm at the Scotch by defining oats as being a food for
horses in England and for men in Scotland. Had he lived
now, and seen how generally oats are employed as an article of
human food, his definition would have been far different and
much more valuable. It is due to Scotland, in passing, to say
that she produces a very superior quality of oats.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of oats, all of which have probably
arisen from the same species of <i>avena</i>. The ordinary oats
have the hull or husk adherent to the kernel, and are divided
into two classes. In one, the flower cluster branches from
both sides of the stem, while in the other, the branches are all
upon one side. There is a group of “skinless” sorts, but little
grown, in which the husk separates from its contents.</p>

<p>The total area in oats in the United States in 1880 was
16,144,593, with a yield of 467,858,999, or an average of not far
from twenty-nine bushels per acre. Illinois, Iowa, New York,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin lead in the amount of oats grown,
and in the order mentioned. These five states produce over
half of all the oats grown in this country. Maine, Vermont,
New York and Wyoming raise more oats than any other grain.</p>

<p>Oats vary greatly in weight per bushel, the heaviest being produced
in a cold, moist climate. In Scotland they frequently
weigh fifty pounds to the bushel, while with us the legal weight is
thirty-two, with a range of from twenty to forty-five pounds to
the bushel. Oat straw is much relished by sheep and cattle, and
is superior to that of barley or wheat. Oats are grown extensively
in some localities as a substitute for hay, and are cut before
they begin to ripen. They also make an excellent forage
crop, and after being pastured off the ground the soil is left in
a fine condition for the next crop.</p>

<p>The composition of corn meal and Graham is given for the
sake of a convenient comparison. It will be seen that oats,
and especially the meal, or flour, is rich in nitrogenous or muscle
forming compounds, namely, the albuminoids. There is
also a very large per cent. of fat, and less starch than in corn
or wheat.</p>

<p>Of the nutritive value of oatmeal Professor Brewer notes:
“Whether it is true that oatmeal is actually more wholesome
or more nutritious than cracked wheat, for example, is very
questionable, but it certainly is more palatable to work people.
In the United States oatmeal in any form has been but sparingly
used for human food until within a few years, but of late
its consumption has increased enormously, many grocers now
selling as many barrels a year as they sold pounds less than a
score of years ago. This increase in the use of oatmeal is most
marked in the cities of the older states, but it has extended to
the villages and farms and even to the farthest frontier settlements.”</p>

<p>The enemies to the oat crop are not as many as of wheat.
The rust and smut do some injury, as also the insects that feed
upon wheat and other cereals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice</span> (<i>Oryza sativa</i><a href="#kitchen4" id="anch_kitchen4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) it is believed enters more largely into
the nourishment of the human family than any other plant. It
is a native of the East Indies, but is now cultivated in most
tropical and sub-tropical climates. The rice plant requires an
abundance of water in the soil, and thrives best on land
subject to overflow for a portion of the year, or which is artificially
flooded. Rice is most largely grown in India, China,
Japan and Egypt—India alone producing nearly thirty million
bushels per year. The rice grown in this country is confined
to eight states, with an area of 174,173 acres in 1879, and
a yield of 110,131,373 pounds, averaging 632 pounds per acre.
Ninety per cent. of this crop is grown in the three following
states: South Carolina, Louisiana, and Georgia. It is seen
that the region suited to the growth of rice is much more limited
than with the other cereals. The following description of
rice growing in the South is from the <i>American Agriculturist</i>:
“The method pursued on the rice lands of the lower Mississippi
is to sow the rice broadcast about as thick as wheat at
the North, and harrow it in with a light harrow having many
teeth, the ground being first well plowed and prepared by
ditches and embankments for inundation at will. It is generally
sown in March. Immediately after sowing the water is
let on so as to barely overflow the ground. The water is withdrawn
on the second, third or fourth day, or as soon as the
grain begins to swell. The rice very soon after comes up and
grows finely. When it has attained about three inches in
height the water is again let on, the top leaves being left a little
above the water. Complete immersion would kill the
plant. A fortnight previous to harvest the water is drawn off
to give the stalks strength and to dry the ground for the convenience
of the reapers.… The same area of ground yields
three times as much rice as wheat.… Rice, like hemp, does
not impoverish the soil.… The pine barrens of Mississippi
would produce rice <i>ad infinitum</i> if it were not that the land,
after a few years, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, becomes
too dry for it.… No variety has been discovered
which yields as much out of the water as it does in it.… It
flourishes better when overflowed with pure running water than
with the stagnant waters of impure lakes and marshes.”</p>

<p>The chemical composition of rice grain is as follows:
Water 12.44, ash 0.38, albuminoids 7.44, fiber 0.19, starch, etc.
19.20, fat 0.35. It is seen to contain a less amount of the flesh
forming or albuminoid compounds, and a greater per cent. of
heat producing or starchy matter, than the other grains. The
flour contains so little gluten that it can not be made into light
bread. Rice is familiar to all as white, pearly grains, which
are employed as the leading ingredient of puddings, etc. The
outer covering or husk is removed in the process of threshing,
but to separate the inner requires expensive machinery. “The
rough rice is first ground between very heavy stones running
at a high speed, which partially removes the hull chaff.
The grain is conveyed into mortars, where it is pounded for
a certain length of time by the alternate rising and falling of
very heavy pestles shod with iron. From these mortars elevators
carry the rice to the fans which separate the grain from
the remaining husks. From here it goes through other fans
which divide it into three qualities—‘whole,’ ‘middling’ and
‘small.’ The whole rice is then passed through a polishing
screen, lined with gauze wire and sheepskins, which, revolving
vertically at the greatest possible speed, gives it the pearly
whiteness with which it appears in commerce.” The “small”
rice is sometimes ground and employed to adulterate wheat
flour. Rice, when prepared in the many forms of puddings,
cakes, soups, etc., is very easy of digestion, and is specially
fitted for the food of invalids. In Japan, where the rice crop
is a leading one, an alcoholic drink called <i>sake</i> is made from
it. A wine is made in China from this grain, and the <i>Arrack</i>
of the East is also a rice beverage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buckwheat</span> (<i>Polygonnum esculentum</i><a href="#kitchen5" id="anch_kitchen5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>). The six grains already
treated in this and the preceding article are all members
of the great grass family. The remaining cereal belongs to another
and distantly related group of plants. Buckwheat is a member
of a small family containing the knotweeds, bindweeds, smartweeds,
dock and rhubarb. The buckwheat plant in its growth
and structure is very different from the grasses. It is supposed
to be a native of northern Asia, and has been cultivated for its
large, triangular seeds, from very early times. The name is
derived from the German <i>Buck-weizen</i>, “beech wheat,” the
shape of the grain closely resembling that of the beech nut.</p>

<p>The buckwheat crop in the United States for 1879 was 11,817,227<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
bushels, for 848,389 acres, or about fourteen bushels
per acre. The increase in the total yield of buckwheat is not
keeping pace with the increase in population. New York and
Pennsylvania are the leading buckwheat producing states, sixty-eight
per cent. of the whole crop of 1879 being grown within
their borders. Hilly regions, with a thin soil, that are not
suited to other grains, may be profitably devoted to growing
buckwheat. It is known as a “wide feeder;” that is, the buckwheat
plant produces long, wide-spreading roots which penetrate
the poor soil for long distances and gather nourishment
over a wide area. On this account this crop is frequently
grown on worn-out soil and plowed under while green as a fertilizer,
in preparation for some other crop requiring more plant
food close at hand in the soil. The period of growth is short,
being sown in midsummer and harvested before the autumn
frosts have an opportunity to injure it. It frequently serves a
good purpose as a second crop where the first has failed from
poor seed, bad weather, destructive insects, or one or more of
these or other causes. The grain is especially wholesome for
poultry, and while the field is in bloom bees harvest a larger
store of honey, though not of the best quality.</p>

follows:</p>

<p>The albuminoids are seen to be only about half as abundant
as in wheat flour. The fiber (bran) is in large quantity and
the starchy matter abounds. As a food buckwheat is less
strengthening but somewhat more fattening than wheat. The
popular notion that buckwheat when eaten regularly will induce
a feverish state of the system and eruption of the skin, is
probably well founded. The plant belongs to a family, many
members of which have peculiar medicinal principles, and
doubtless there is some oil or other substance present in the
buckwheat that does not appear in a chemical analysis, though
active upon the animal system.</p>

<p>There are very few enemies to the buckwheat plant. So infrequent
are the attacks of insects that the crop is recommended
by Professor Riley as a means of driving insects away from
fields. It is a very cleansing crop as regards weeds also, the
rank growth smothering out the various forms of plant pests
that may spring up. The buckwheat field is, of course, not exempt
from the ravages of those insects like locust and army
worms, that devour everything green in their line of march.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Cereals.</span>—Small quantities of a number of other
cereals have been and are still cultivated in the United States.
There are several millets grown for forage, but the aggregate
amount is only a trifle compared with the other cereals, and
they are not on the increase. One of these millets is quite
extensively grown for the dried branches of the seed-bearing
tops called the “brush,” and is familiar to every housekeeper
as brooms, when attached to long handles. Another variety of
the very fertile species, <i>Sorghum vulgare</i>,<a href="#kitchen6" id="anch_kitchen6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is the durra or doura
grown to some extent in the Southern States as a forage crop.
But it is not our purpose to discuss the many varieties of plants
that have been experimented with or are grown to only a
small extent. Professor Brewer, than whom there is no better
authority, and who has been laid under liberal contribution for
facts in our two papers on the cereals, says: “The established
cereals have been so long cultivated, are so differentiated into
varieties, so adapted to different phases of cultivation, and to
various uses to which man applies them, that it seems probable
that the number will not be materially increased in cultivation,
and, moreover, in our agriculture Indian corn so fills a
part which in other countries is occupied by a number of other
plants, either for forage or bread, that it will doubtless continue
to exclude various species whose cultivation is practiced elsewhere.”
If we do the best we can with the six cereals now
grown we will have no cause for distress.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="THE_CEREALS">THE CEREALS: BARLEY, OATS, RICE AND BUCKWHEAT.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The cereals furnish the cook materials for many of her most
valuable articles of food. Wholesome, easily prepared, and
inexpensive, their use on the table can not be too strongly commended.
Barley is not in general use among Americans, but
the pearled barley ought to form an indispensable article in
every larder. In soups it is excellent. The stock for barley
soup should be made with the greatest care. Into your soup-kettle—every
housewife needs one—put a carefully washed
beef bone, and with it all your scraps of cold meat, trimmings
from steaks, and bones of chickens, turkey and beefsteak.
Put your meat into cold, clear water and for the first half hour
allow it but a moderate heat; after that the pot should be
placed on the back of the stove, allowing the soup to simmer
for four or five hours. This low heat extracts all the juices
from the meat, and, this done, the liquor should be strained
and allowed to cool. When ready to use the thick layer of
grease which forms on the top of the stock should be removed,
and the vegetables—the more the better—which are to flavor
the soup added. Allow this to simmer until the vegetables
have given up their juices, then strain, and into your soup put
pepper and salt, with a cup and a half of barley, and allow
the whole to come to a boil. Serve hot. Cold and greasy
soup is detestable. To prepare the barley for use it should be
soaked for several hours and cooked until soft over a slow
fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef with Barley.</span>—Beef is nice served with barley. A
beef roast may be garnished with barley which has been boiled,
and a steak is oftentimes served in barley. Pieces of cold beef
may be warmed over with this cereal in the following way:
Mince into dice the scraps of meat, butter a sauce pan thoroughly,
pour in a little water and add equal quantities of the
minced meat and cold boiled barley. Stir until hot, then pour
in two eggs slightly beaten, and stir until the eggs are cooked;
season with salt and pepper. Cold mutton may be prepared
with rice in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barley for the Sick.</span>—“From the times of Hippocrates<a href="#cereals" id="anch_cereals1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and Galen,”<a href="#cereals" id="anch_cereals2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> says a writer, “barley drinks have been in high
repute in febrile and inflammatory complaints. They possess
mild, soothing qualities, while at the same time they impart
nourishment.” For <i>barley water</i> the following is a standard
recipe: Wash pearled barley in four waters, rub two or three
pieces of sugar on a lemon cut open and put them in a jug
with the washed barley and a few slices of lemon; then pour
boiling water over the whole and cover it until it is cold.
<i>Barley gruel</i> is made by boiling two ounces of the pearled
barley in half a pint of water; strain off this water and put the
barley into three pints and a half of salted boiling water, and
let it boil half away, then strain it for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oatmeal.</span>—Of the good qualities of this Scottish favorite,
most of us are aware. “Oatmeal is,” says one authority,
“when eaten with milk, a perfect food, having all the requisites
for growing children and the young generally. Oatmeal requires
much cooking to effectually burst its starch cells, but
when it is well cooked it will thicken liquid much more than equal
its weight in wheaten flour. The oats of this country are superior
to those grown on the continent and in the southern parts of
England, but certainly inferior to the Scotch, where considerable
pains is taken to cultivate them; and it is needless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
point out that the Scotch are an example of a strong and robust
nation, which result is justly set down as being derived
from the plentiful use of oatmeal. Dr. Guthrie has asserted
that his countrymen have the largest heads of any nation in
the world—not even the English have such large heads—which
he attributes to the universal use of oatmeal.” The almost
universal method of using oatmeal is in porridge, or mush, as
we almost always call this excellent dish. There are two
methods of preparing mush: To one quart of boiling water
add one teaspoonful of salt; take a heaping cupful of oatmeal
and sprinkle it slowly in with one hand while it is stirred with
the other. When the meal has been all put in it should not
be stirred more than is necessary to keep it from burning at
the bottom. If much stirred the porridge will be starchy and
flavorless. A better porridge may be made by stirring at
night into two pints of salted boiling water half a pint of oatmeal.
Let it boil for two or three minutes, then cover closely
and place on the back of the range where it may simmer until
breakfast time. Oatmeal may also be steamed. <i>Fried oatmeal</i>
is a nice breakfast dish. Take steamed oatmeal when
it is cold, cut it in thin slices, and fry until it is brown in a little
lard or butter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oatmeal Gruel.</span>—A valuable item on an invalid’s bill of
fare is oatmeal gruel. “Take two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal,
half a blade of mace, a piece of lemon peel, three gills of milk,
and a little sugar. Mix two spoonfuls of oatmeal until smooth
in a little milk, and stir it gradually into the remainder of the
milk; add the lemon peel and blade of mace; set it over the
fire for fifteen minutes, stirring it constantly. Then strain it
and add sugar to taste.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice.</span>—For simply boiling rice we have an excellent
“black man’s recipe” given in one of our favorite cook books
by an old sea-captain friend of ours. Here it is just as it was
told the “captain:” “Wash him well; much wash in cold
water; the rice, flour, make him stick; water boil already very
fast; throw him in, rice can’t burn, water shake him too much;
boil quarter of an hour or a little more; rub one rice in thumb
and finger; if all rub away him quite done; put rice in cullender,
hot water run away; pour cup of cold water on him, put
back rice in saucepan, keep him covered near the fire, then
rice all ready; eat him up.”</p>

<p>Equally good is rice cooked by steaming. After washing
thoroughly, soak for an hour in warm water, three pints of water
to one of rice. Set the dish containing the rice and water
in which it has been soaking into the steamer and allow it to
steam for an hour. It should be salted after put to steam and
stirred frequently. Milk may take the place of part of the
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Waffles.</span>—Into one and a half pints of flour stir a
little salt, and rub in evenly a piece of butter the size of a walnut,
add three beaten eggs, mixed with half a teacupful of sweet
milk, one and a half pints of boiled rice and half a teacupful
of sour milk, with one teaspoonful of soda; bake immediately
in waffle irons. Rice pancakes may be made by adding an
extra half cupful of milk. These pancakes may be served
with jelly. When hot from the griddle spread them with butter
and almost any kind of preserves or jelly; roll them up as
you do roll jelly-cake, cut off the ends, arrange them on a
platter, sprinkle sugar over the tops, and serve immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Served with Meat.</span>—Rice may be used as a side dish
with any kind of meat. <i>Risotto à la Milanaise</i><a href="#cereals" id="anch_cereals3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is a favorite
dish. Put one ounce of butter into a stew-pan and when hot
mix in a quarter of a small onion minced, cook until it turns
yellow; put in a cupful of uncooked rice and stir it until it has
become yellow from the butter and onion; now add a pint of
stock and boil slowly until the rice is tender. The stock
should be nearly all absorbed; before serving add an ounce
of grated cheese and stir for a few moments over the fire without
letting it boil. Sprinkle a little grated cheese over the
top. Another very simple side dish is prepared from rice by
mixing a tablespoonful of minced parsley or shives into a
pint of boiled rice. Put an ounce of butter into a sauce pan,
heat it until it becomes a light brown; mix the rice in the butter
and serve as a vegetable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Desserts from Rice.</span>—The rice pudding is undoubtedly
the standard rice dessert, but it is only one of numberless
wholesome and toothsome dishes which may be prepared.
The simplest form of this pudding and the most delicious is a
simple compound of rice, sugar and milk. To two quarts of
milk add one cupful of rice and one of sugar, a small pinch of
salt, and the desired flavoring. Place the mixture where it
will heat very slowly. When the milk becomes boiling hot
place the pudding in a slow oven and let it bake for an hour.
Do not stir after placing in the oven. A more elaborate pudding
is made by dissolving a tablespoonful of corn starch in
three cupfuls of milk; add the yolks of two eggs beaten into
three-quarters of a cupful of sugar. Put this mixture over the
fire and when hot add one cupful of hot boiled rice; stir this
until it thickens, then take it off the fire and add the flavoring.
Put it into a pudding dish and place in the oven until it is
slightly brown; remove and spread over the top the whites of
two eggs beaten to a stiff froth and thickened with a little
sugar, return the pudding to the oven for a few minutes until
the frosting is of a delicate brown color.</p>

<p>Among the many other practical and excellent desserts of
rice, the following from Mrs. Henderson’s “Practical Cooking”
we know to be good:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Cones.</span>—Mould boiled rice, when hot, into cups which
have been previously dipped in cold water; when cold turn
them out on a flat dish; with a teaspoon scoop out a little of
the rice from the top of each cone, and put in its place any
kind of jelly. Any sauce preferred may be served with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Cake with Peaches.</span>—Cook the rice in a steamer with
milk, and when still hot add a little butter, sugar, and one or
two eggs. Butter a plain pudding mould, strew the butter
with bread crumbs and put in a layer of rice half an inch
thick; then a layer of peaches, and continue alternate layers
of each until the mould is full. Bake this for about fifteen or
twenty minutes in an oven; when done turn the cake out of
the mould, and pour into the dish any desired sauce. Other
fruits may be used with rice in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orange Snow Balls.</span>—Boil some rice for ten minutes,
drain, and let it cool. Pare some oranges, taking off all the
thick, white skin; spread the rice in as many portions as there
are oranges, on pudding cloths. Tie the fruit, surrounded by
the rice, separately in these and boil the balls for an hour;
turn them carefully on a dish, sprinkle over plenty of sifted
sugar, serve with sauce or sweetened cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple Snow Balls</span> may be prepared in the same way, the
apples being pared and cored without dividing them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span>—Soak a half a pound of rice three or
four hours in water; drain and put into a basin with one quart
of milk and a little salt. Set the basin in the steamer and cook
until thoroughly done; then stir in carefully one teacupful of
sugar, the yolks of two eggs, a very little butter and flavoring.
When cold enough to handle, form into small balls; press the
thumb into the center of each; insert a little marmalade or
jelly of any kind, and close the rice well over them; roll in
beaten eggs (sweetened a little) and bread crumbs. Fry in
boiling hot lard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice for the Sick.</span>—Rice jelly is an excellent food for invalids.
It is made from rice flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls
of which are mixed with water and made into a thin paste.
This paste must be stirred into a cupful of boiling water, and
the whole sweetened. It should be boiled until it is transparent
and then put into a mould.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ground Rice Milk</span> is prepared by boiling together two
tablespoonfuls of ground rice with a pint of milk. Sweeten it
according to taste, adding the juice of a lemon. Let it boil
half an hour over a moderate fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parched Rice.</span>—Brown rice as you do coffee. Put into boiling
salted water and cook thoroughly; serve with cream and sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buckwheat.</span>—Our last cereal, buckwheat, bears the burden
of many complaints. It is called the cause of much of our
dyspepsia, and in many households it has been displaced by
corn, rye or flannel cakes. As usually made buckwheat cakes
are heavy, greasy and sour. Great quantities of butter and
syrup are consumed with them to hide the taste of the cake itself,
but when properly made there is little doubt but that they
are as digestible as any warm breakfast cake. An unfailing
recipe is the following, which if a little more troublesome than
the usual method, still is worth the trouble. Add to two quarts
of boiling water half a pint of corn meal, wet with a little cold
water; boil until it forms a thin gruel, to which, when cool,
add half a pint of wheat flour, three pints of buckwheat flour,
one gill of yeast, and a little salt. The imperfect fermentation
or rising of the batter causes most of the “heavy” cakes.
To avoid this set your batter thus prepared at noon of the day
before you use them; in the evening beat them well and let
them rise in a cool place until morning. A little soda and a
little warm water are the only additions which will be required
before baking for breakfast.</p>

<p>A quaint old book called “The Tin Trumpet” remarks that
“three bad mothers have borne three good daughters.” Long-Suffering
begat Patience, Astrology gave birth to Astronomy,
and Chemistry is the daughter of Alchemy. The facts of science
have taken the place of the fancies of the early investigators.
Men used to be attacked, when they entered ravines
and caverns, by supernatural beings, as they supposed, who
choked, and sometimes killed them. In 1754 Joseph Black
showed that these fatal results were due alone to the presence
of an invisible gas, which he called “fixed air,” as he found it
locked up in limestone. “Geist,” the name invented by Van
Helmont to represent this strange power, signified ghost or
spirit, so that the “ghosts” of the seventeenth century are the
gases of the nineteenth. The word gas is derived from <i>geist</i>.</p>

<p>In studying the history of science we often wonder at the
near approach which men made to truths which remained undiscovered
for a long time after. One finds, all along, intimations
of approaching disclosures which resemble those peculiarities
in animals and plants that the geologist notes in the
lower strata of the rocks, as prophesying the development
of future species. The astrologer failed in his attempt to read
human destiny, but he led men forward to the time when, in
the stars, they should read the “thoughts of God.” The alchemist
did not succeed in distilling the “elixir of life,” but
he prepared the way for chemists to make those useful discoveries
which have greatly promoted the safety and comfort of
men and extended the period of human life. Some of the
most important investigations in which science is now engaged
concern the character and contents of that all-pervading aërial
ocean which surrounds our earth to the height of from fifty to
five hundred miles. Pure air is one of the great essentials of
health and life. How to secure it is a difficult but beneficent
inquiry which the spectroscope, microscope and chemical analysis
may yet answer.</p>

<h4>COMPOSITION OF AIR.</h4>

<p>Air is a <i>mixture</i>, and not a compound. This distinction, as
before intimated, is one of great importance. A cup of coffee
is a good illustration of the former; there we have united
water, coffee, cream, and sugar, but no new substance is
thereby produced, and each of these ingredients may be removed
without affecting the others. Gunpowder is a mixture,
being composed of sulphur, nitre, and charcoal—a most admirable
mixture it is, too, for every particle of it contains these three
substances, as may be shown; the sulphur may be removed
by heat, and the nitre by washing, leaving the carbon alone;
the microscope also would reveal in each grain these three substances.
That the air is a mixture can be proven in two ways.
First, water will absorb each of its two principal ingredients,
and, secondly, they do not exist in air in that definite ratio
which always characterizes chemical combination. The principal
materials in air are oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic di-oxide,
watery vapor, ammonia, and very minute portions of many
other materials. Professor Steele says, that if the entire atmosphere
were compressed to the density of that immediately
surrounding the earth, it would extend above it only about five
miles. Now, if the substances entering into its composition
were to be arranged in the order of their specific gravity,
watery vapor would form a sheet about the earth five inches
deep, carbonic di-oxide another just above it, thirteen feet in
depth, then a layer of oxygen one mile thick, and nitrogen
another layer above that, four miles in thickness.</p>

<p>In short, four-fifths of the air is nitrogen, about one-fifth is
oxygen, four ten-thousandths is carbonic acid, and water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
exists in variable quantities. It will be readily seen that the
chemical and physical changes constantly going on in the surface
of the earth must be throwing off other materials into the
atmosphere. For example, the spectroscope has shown that
common salt exists almost everywhere in the air. This arises
from the fact that the ocean surrounds all lands, and its yeasty
waves are broken into foam which is caught up by the winds
and borne over the whole earth. One of the most remarkable
facts connected with this subject is the wonderful uniformity
of this mixture. Upon the whole, the amount of each ingredient
is nearly the same. Some slight variations, such as the
following, are observable: More CO₂ is found near cities than
in the country, and there is more of the same over the land
than over the sea. That the substances which enter into the
composition of air do not arrange themselves according to
weight, is due to a most interesting law called</p>

<h4>THE DIFFUSION OF GASES.</h4>

<p class="caption">PHOSPHORUS BURNING IN AIR.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Experiment.</span>—Prepare nitrogen as described elsewhere in this article.</p>

</div>

<p>By this we mean that gases tend to intermingle, the
lighter even descending, and the heavier ascending, until they
occupy the same space. This can be shown in the following
manner: Fill one bottle with hydrogen, and another with carbonic
acid gas, fit into each a cork, perforated so as to admit a
tube, connect the two by inserting a tube, placing the bottle of
hydrogen above with the top downward; although the carbonic
acid is twenty-two times heavier than the hydrogen, in
an hour or two it will rise into the bottle above, as can be
proved by pouring into it some lime water, which will immediately
become milky, showing that the carbonic acid has
united with the lime, forming calcium carbonate. That the
hydrogen has passed down into the other bottle may be demonstrated
by first absorbing such portions of the carbonic acid
as still remain by pouring in cream of lime, when there will
be found still in the bottle a substance (hydrogen) which will
burn with a faint yellowish light. Another pleasing experiment
may be performed in the following manner: Take an
unglazed porcelain cup, fit to it a brass cap, perforated so as
to admit tightly a long glass tube, insert one end of the tube into
some colored water contained in a goblet, the inverted cup being
supported above on the other end of the tube; now hold over
the cup a jar filled with hydrogen; bubbles will soon be seen
escaping through the water from the lower end of the tube,
showing that the hydrogen has entered and mingled with the
air; remove the jar, and the liquid will rise in the tube, proving
that the gas has escaped from the cup. This diffusive force
in the atmosphere prevents the accumulation of noxious gases
by distributing them throughout the whole mass. The constant
agitation of the air in gales and storms facilitates this
operation, and it is only in certain confined places like caves,
such as the Grotto del Cane,<a href="#chemistry1" id="anch_chemistry1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> mines, and wells, that we find apparent
exception.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maury has said that the atmosphere makes the
whole world akin. The breezes that blow over <i>our</i> land may
in turn visit every other, carrying bane or blessing. Alas! we
fear, to-day, that the feverish breath which poisons the air of
Italy may spread its pestilence to our shores. One lesson we
learn from this is, that the misery or prosperity of any one portion
of the earth may affect every other; and that which benefits
a part, contributes in this way a blessing to the whole.</p>

<h4>NITROGEN.</h4>

<p>In our first article of this series somewhat extended reference
was made to oxygen, and we shall therefore not dwell
upon that element at this time.</p>

<p>Nitrogen, which constitutes by <i>measure</i> 79.04, and by <i>weight</i>
76.8 of the air, is remarkable for the absence of positive qualities.
It is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas, will not burn,
nor support life or combustion. Its chief office is that of a
diluter. Without it we should live too fast; even as it is we
live too fast! With oxygen alone to breathe, ours would be a
short and fevered existence. All flames and fires would be
kindled into furious combustion, stoves themselves would burn,
and the very “elements melt with fervent heat.”</p>

<p class="caption">MERCURY DISSOLVING IN NITRIC ACID.</p>

</div>

<p>We can prepare air artificially, by mixing one part of O with
four parts of N, thoroughly shaking them together. Nitrogen
can easily be obtained in the following manner: Make a small
cavity in a piece of cork; line this by sifting into it a little
plaster or crayon dust. Place the cork on some water in a
deep plate. Insert now in the cavity a piece of dry phosphorus
(always handle phosphorus with care), touch the P with a
heated wire, and quickly place over it an inverted jar. White
fumes will instantly rise, which are phosphoric anhydride, P₂O₅.
These will be quickly absorbed by the water, and the
water will rise and fill one-fifth of the jar. It will be necessary
to add water as that in the plate rises. The remaining four-fifths
of the jar will be occupied by nitrogen.</p>

<p>The following is an instructive experiment: Take two jars of
equal size (one open at both ends), one of which is fitted with
a stopper; fill one with O and the other with N. Place a
smooth glass plate under each before removing the pneumatic
trough, and holding the plates closely over the top, invert one
jar on the other—plate to plate—the jar of O being below.
Now carefully remove the plates, and also the stopper from the
jar of N, and quickly insert a lighted taper with a long snuff.
As it descends through the N it will be extinguished, but as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
enters the O it will be rekindled. This may be repeated many
times by raising and lowering the taper. N does not seem to
be strongly attached to anything; that is, it has but slight
affinity for the substances with which it combines. Strange
enough, from this sluggishness results a marvelous activity.
Being held with such little force it is liable at any time to be
liberated in the form of a gas, and the decomposition of the
whole compound of which it formed a part will take place.
Hence, instability is the most marked characteristic of N. It
reminds one of some loafer, without steady occupation or aims,
restless, vacillating, but always a factor in every turbulence
or outbreak.</p>

<p class="caption">BISMUTH DISSOLVING IN NITRIC ACID.</p>

</div>

<p>Gunpowder, gun-cotton, nitro-glycerine, and dynamite all
contain N, and their explosive character depends largely upon
its presence. Nitrogen and chlorine form a compound, which
explodes with such terrific violence that its manufacture should
never be attempted by students.</p>

<p>Nitrogen iodide is another of these dangerous combinations.
It can be made in very small quantities, however, in the form
of a black powder, which may be handled with impunity while it
is damp. The touch of a feather, or a zephyr, will sometimes explode
it when dry. It is almost impossible to keep it; the jar of a
foot-fall or slamming of a door is often sufficient to liberate the
unstable nitrogen, and the substance disappears with a loud
report. The tremendous rending force of dynamite is well
known. A small charge in a torpedo will sink a ship. The
Greely Relief Expedition used it to open their way through
the arctic ice fields. Its atoms rush apart with such frightful
velocity that if a pound of it be exploded upon a naked bowlder,
of many tons weight, the rock is shivered into fragments.</p>

<h4>COMPOUNDS OF N AND O.</h4>

<p>At every breath we take into the lungs a mixture of N
and O. The operation is not only harmless, but essential
to life. When, however, N and O are <i>compounded</i>, the
resulting substances are very different. Nitrous oxide (N₂O)
forms the well known laughing gas, which breathed, produces
for a time a species of intoxication, and if its inhalation
is continued, results in insensibility. Nitric oxide (NO)
when first formed consists of suffocating red fumes, while nitric
acid (HNO₃) is a very corrosive liquid which will cauterize
flesh, and acts with great energy upon most of the metals. It
is sometimes termed aqua fortis, and is much used in etching
upon copper. The surface of the metal plate is covered with
varnish or wax, upon which the design is then traced by a
sharp pointed instrument. The acid is then applied and remains
until, in the judgment of the artist, the impression is
deep enough. Any one can easily etch his name, in this way,
on a knife blade, or make a stencil plate from a thin strip of
brass or copper. Silver, copper, mercury, lead, zinc, iron,
bismuth can all be dissolved by nitric acid.</p>

<p>The five compounds of N and O admirably illustrate the laws
of atomic combination. Their symbols are as follows: Nitrogen
monoxide, N₂O; nitric oxide, NO; nitrogen trioxide,
N₂O₃; nitrogen peroxide, NO₂; nitrogen pentoxide, N₂O₅. A
careful examination of the weights of these substances, which
may be made by consulting some good chemical manual,
will show that there is an exact ratio of combination, their proportional
weights being respectively as 1¾ to 1, 1¾ to 2, 1¾
to 3, 1¾ to 4, 1¾ to 5. Since atoms can not be divided they
must combine atom for atom, or in multiples. This principle
has been more fully stated in the form of six</p>

<h4>LAWS OF COMBINATION.</h4>

<p>The first law of weights says that the elements of a given
compound always unite in the same proportions, by weight.
The second law is, that if two or more substances unite to form
several compounds, their highest combining proportions will
always be multiples of their lowest combining weights. The
third law announces that the combining weight of a compound
is the sum of the combining proportions of its constituents.
The volumetric laws are as follows: 1, If two or more elements
unite to form a compound, their proportion by volume will always
be the same; 2, if they unite to form a variety of compounds,
these proportions will always be multiples of the lowest
combining volumes. 3. The third law is most curious of all; that
the combining volume of a gaseous compound is always 2. For
example, if two elements represented by x and y unite in proportion
of one volume of x to one of y, there would be formed
two volumes of the compound. If there should be two volumes
of x and one of y there would be two volumes of the compound,
and if they should unite three volumes of x and one of y, again
there would be but two volumes of the product. Just why two
should be such a favorite number is difficult to explain. No
one can carefully study these interesting laws without perceiving
the necessity for a rare intelligence in arranging all materials
with such mathematical exactness.</p>

<p>How absurd to ascribe to <i>atoms</i> the power to count, to weigh,
to measure, to arrange themselves in orderly combinations
which surpass the most skilful marshaling of battalions on a
great battle field. It would be to make gods of atoms.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, as the story goes, the King of the Acids,
whose name is Sulphuric, arrogantly walked forth to view his
wide domain. He was sour and fierce. Many conquests had
made him boastful, until he thought himself the mightiest of the
earth. Soon he came to where the King of the Metals, whose
name is Gold, sat in royal state, his countenance shining with
wonderful beauty. The haughty monarch of the Acids was
angered as he approached, to see that his rival did not recognize
him, nor acknowledge his power. “I am mightier than
thou!” he said, but King Gold smiled in silent derision.
Thereupon the former fiercely attacked him, but was easily
repulsed. The savage aggressor, insane with rage, went
away muttering, “I have two sons who can slay thee!” He
instantly commanded Nitric Acid and Hydrochloric at once
to unite in an attack upon his opponent. Their father gave
them a banner on which was inscribed “Aqua Regia,” which
might be translated “King Slayer.” It was indeed too true a
symbol. Alas! before their combined onslaught the royal metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
yielded. The old king now grew more arrogant than ever,
and boastfully announced that his sway knew no limits. One
day he discovered, in his walk, one of a smooth and gentle
countenance, yet with an expression indicating that if aroused
he might make biting and caustic replies. It was Potassa,
King of the Alkalies. From hot words, they soon passed to
blows, until in the wild struggle both were slain. Horrible to
contemplate, they ate each other! The spot on which they
perished can still be pointed out. This story is a warning to
vaulting ambition, and a tragedy surpassed in pathos only by
the mournful story of the Kilkenny cats!<a href="#chemistry2" id="anch_chemistry2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h4>CARBONIC ANHYDRIDE, CO₂.</h4>

<p>This substance is also called carbonic di-oxide and carbonic
acid gas. It is the dreaded “choke-damp” of the miner. It
Is produced when carbon unites with O, whether by the
decay of vegetation, combustion of vegetable matter, or the
oxidation of the blood. It is so heavy that it may be poured
or dipped out from vessel to vessel, like water. It extinguishes
flame, and is largely employed for that purpose in contrivances
like the Babcock Fire Extinguisher,<a href="#chemistry3" id="anch_chemistry3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the more recent
Fire Grenade.<a href="#chemistry4" id="anch_chemistry4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Taken into the stomach in the form of soda
water it is refreshing and beneficial, but its inhalation is always
injurious, and will produce death if breathed in considerable
quantity, by causing asphyxia.<a href="#chemistry5" id="anch_chemistry5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A practical problem of
great importance is that of ventilation, as this material is constantly
being thrown off from the lungs, of both animals and
men. In the days of ample fire-places, our homes, if they had
less heat had purer air. The railroad car, in point of comfort,
is a marvelous improvement over the ancient stage coach, but
the latter was better in the matter of ventilation. The sleepiness
of congregations should be attributed as much to the foul
air as to the dull preaching. Can not some of our writers on
homiletics prepare us a stirring chapter on the relation of
carbonic acid to eloquence?</p>

<p>Homes, school houses, and all public buildings should be
supplied in some way with a gentle and universal circulation
of air. Fierce draughts should by all means be avoided.
Ventilation is now generally best secured by the construction
of flues in the wall, which have openings in the lower and
upper portion of the room. The world yet waits to bless the
inventor of a simple and effective system of ventilation which
is of universal application.</p>

<h4>OTHER ATMOSPHERES.</h4>

<p>As has been suggested, there must be in the air a variable
quantity of other substances beside those named as forming
its mass. Ammonia gas (NH₃) is present, and it is from this
material that most of the nitrogen found in plants is obtained.
Water readily absorbs it and conveys it to the roots. Other
elements require only additional heat to volatilize them. Almost
all of the elements of nature have been liquefied; carbonic
acid has been solidified, forming a beautiful white solid, intensely
cold. It is generally accepted as a truth that all substances
could be solidified by the sufficient removal of heat,
and it would of course follow that they could all be vaporized
by applying heat enough. In earlier geologic times many of
the materials forming our earth must have existed as vapor in
the heated atmosphere, and the time will come when our globe
will have no atmosphere, no seas, lakes, nor rivers. It will
float in space, cold and desolate like the moon.</p>

<p>The opposite of this condition can be seen to-day in many of
the heavenly bodies. The spectroscope reveals in the sun’s
atmosphere gold, iron, copper, zinc, and many other substances.
Vast disturbances are constantly heaving and tossing
these materials, which are intensely heated. The cyclonic
movements are so violent and extensive that the wildest hurricanes
of our earth would seem as zephyrs in comparison.</p>

<p>Hydrogen flames have flared out one hundred thousand
miles from its surface. It has been suggested that the mighty
fires in the sun may be fed by millions of meteoric bodies
which are tossed into its raging heats by the power of gravity.
Nothing could withstand such terrible combustion. Lockyer
says that if all of the sun’s heat were concentrated upon a
mass of ice as large as the earth it would melt it in two minutes,
and convert it into vapor in fifteen.</p>

<p>Science has accomplished few things more wonderful than
that of crossing over the vast spaces of the universe, and revealing
to us the chemical composition of the celestial atmospheres.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Samuel Daniel, Spenser’s successor as laureate, is unknown
to the general reader, though by the reader of his time he was
well considered, and literary critics of every age have admired
him. He has had no superior in the correct, classic
use of English. Lowell says that in two hundred years not a
dozen of his words or turns of phrase have become obsolete,
a thing that can not be said, probably, of any other English
writer. He failed not in rhythmic skill, or linguistic art, but
in that element which marks the literary genius’ power to
speak to his neighbors in such a way as to speak to all times
and climes. Shakspere’s words are as much at home in one
nation or century as another. Bunyan had a similar skill, so
had Burns, but Daniel had it not. In comparing him with
men of permanent literary fame we see the superiority of processes
to facts, of methods to transient results.</p>

<p>Daniel’s lines are so exquisite that in every age the great
poets have not only been his admirers, but have made systematic
effort to revivify his lines. In the time of Hazlitt, he secured
the coöperation of Lamb and Coleridge, and the three
combined their talent and friends to resurrect his fame by
placing beneath his poems their own genius and reputation, but
they could not call his verses from the oblivion in which they
had been decently interred.</p>

<p>This incident is a capital answer to the charge that great
men, notably literary men, depend upon circumstances for
their fame. Nothing can buoy up fame but the filling of the
veins with a personality through genius. At some stages circumstances
aid, friends are serviceable, but it is the inherent
qualities that survive in the tempestuous waves of public opinion
and criticism. Daniel won the title of voluntary laureate
by serving from Spenser to Ben Jonson without stated financial
reward, though he was benefited financially and otherwise.
Samuel Daniel was born 1562, near Taunton. His father
was a music teacher, and the son studied at Oxford, but did
not take his degree. He published poems at twenty-three.
He was tutor to Lady Anne Clifford, afterward Countess of
Pembroke, and became historian and poet under Earl of Pembroke’s
patronage. His admiration for the Italian verse influenced
his original stanzas, and led him to devote much time
to translations. His most extensive work was the poetic history
of the civil wars between the houses of Lancaster and York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Ben Jonson, who succeeded Daniel, is a curiosity in literature.
Physically, mentally, morally, he was unquestionably
the most unique character among English “Men of Letters.”
In build heavy and uncouth, face broad and long, with square
jaw and large cheeks, disfigured by scurvy, with a “mountain
bellie and ungracious gait.” He was the son of a clergyman
who died before he was born. His mother married shortly
after for her second husband a bricklayer, whom the child royally
disliked. The coarsely framed, energetic lad was, in the
eyes of the step-father, only fitted for manual labor, and consequently
he was taken from school as soon as he could handle
a trowel, and placed at brick laying. In this action two
elements in the boy’s nature were overlooked; combativeness
and pride; and it was not long after this summary parental
authority assigned him menial employment that the impetuous
lad unceremoniously withdrew from home associations to parts
unknown. The army was his retreat, and he was not long in
making a record for personal bravery by meeting a man in
single combat, at the age of seventeen, in the presence of both
armies, Spanish and English, killing his opponent single
handed.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he retired from the army, and for a
brief period resumed his studies, from which he early retreated
and sought a livelihood with his pen at drama writing, and to
assure their success and increase his income he attempted to
act them in the theater, but pride and combativeness led to a
violent quarrel with an associate actor, and in the duel which
followed he killed his opponent with the sword. Arrest and
imprisonment followed, and execution was inevitable but for
the gracious interference of a priest, whose interposition secured
his release before the sentence was passed upon him.</p>

<p>When at twenty years of age he came out of prison his
hands were stained with the blood of two fellow-beings; his
first act was to secure himself a wife, though he had not a
penny in the world, and no visible means of support. This
apparently rash act was the wisest movement of his life, as it
necessitated a vigorous wrestling with poverty for four stern
years, which balanced his temper and disposition and intensified
his mental powers. During these years of galling poverty
be produced under its stimulus the greatest work of his life,
“Every man in his Humor.” His works all show learning of
the highest order. Hume said that he had the learning Shakspere
lacked, but lacked his genius. But when and how did
he acquire it? Largely by unparalleled reading in these four
years when his poverty goaded him to acquire the skill to earn
money with his pen.</p>

<p>He was a scathing critic, lashing play writers, actors and
theater-goers with unmerciful sarcasm in the prefaces of his
plays, until he became the best hated man in England, actors
frequently denouncing him in unmeasured censure before their
audiences, which only goaded him to the public declaration
that he had no fear of “strumpet’s drugs or ruffian’s stab.”</p>

<p>When James VI. of Scotland ascended the throne as James
I. of England, there appeared a comedy styled, “Eastward
Hoe,” written by Jonson’s most intimate friends, Marston and
Chapman. The work reflected sarcastically upon certain
Scotch traits, exasperating the newly crowned king so greatly
that he caused the joint authors to be thrown into prison, and
it was currently reported that they were to lose their noses and
ears.</p>

<p>When Jonson, who was in high favor with the court and
people, heard this report he was exasperated, as he had written
certain passages of the book for them, and he promptly
surrendered himself as a fellow-author, and took his place defiantly
in prison, which placed the king in a most uncomfortable
position, as he had neither the desire nor the courage to mutilate
the face of the most popular writer of the day. The three
were in consequence released, and Jonson gave a great feast
in honor of the event, at which his mother displayed a phial of
violent poison, saying that had he been mutilated she would
first have drank from the deadly phial and then have given
him to drink. He was universally recognized as one of the
most jovial characters of the day, and spent much of his time
with literary companions at the “Mermaid Club,” a socio-literary
association of brilliant men, among whom were Shakspere,
Beaumont, and Fletcher.</p>

<p>When he was appointed laureate he was granted at first a
hundred marks, or about sixty-five pounds, which was soon
advanced to a hundred pounds, which with his literary income
would have sufficed had he the gift of using money wisely,
which he had not, and as life advanced he was continually annoyed
from want of funds. Then it was that his sarcastic habits
of speech bore fruit. When young and vigorous he rejoiced
in his enemies, but as he aged his skill to make enemies
increased, while his youthful powers to ward off their
thrusts was waning. The time came, as it must always come
to men in years, when he had nothing new to say, no vitality
for originating thought, or freshly stating truth, and unfortunately
he was forced to attempt to write for a living, and writing
poorly, his enemies attacked him savagely, setting his
words before the public in absurd relations, saddening the
closing years of life. Misfortunes never come singly, and his
mental chagrin was augmented by the humiliation of being a
paralytic to such an extent that he could not walk, and dropsy
and scurvy intensified his suffering. His wife and children
had died and his only servant and companion was an uncomfortable
old woman. The king withdrew his royal patronage,
and he lived at last only by soliciting favors from his friends.
In Westminster Abbey, where his remains lie among the famous
poets, is a plain, square block of stone, marking the resting
place of this erratic youth, brilliant man, suffering and
neglected senior, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">O Rare Ben Jonson.</span>”</p>

<p>No poet laureate adorned the royal household for a quarter
of a century. Some time before the death of Jonson, Charles
I. had fallen on troublesome times. The poetry of life in court
circles was gone, and even the prose was shorn of its beauty.</p>

<p>It is a strange chapter that recounts the way in which the
Romish church, as well as the English, lost all power in the
nation; the way in which the Presbyterian church, so long an
outlaw, came into power with all the vigor of youth, and almost
instantly went out of power in a panic; the way the ever-to-be-feared
Independent, who never knows law or reason,
came to haunt the dreams of the nobility.</p>

<p>The king was weak, timid, vacillating; the nobility came
to be of no account to anybody; the House of Commons that
prided itself on being radical, suddenly found itself so conservative
as to be frightened even from its parliamentary place
of rendezvous, and became an insignificant factor in the government.
What a day was that in which neither the Romish,
English, or Presbyterian church was of sufficient account to be
consulted, when the king was a cipher, the nobility a minus
quantity, the House of Commons an unknown factor, and two
men, Hampden and Cromwell, rallied fifty Independents, constituted
themselves a law unto themselves, organizing what has
been known in history as the Rump Parliament, and beheaded
Charles I.</p>

<p>In Jonson’s day the king saw the drift of affairs, felt the
throne trembling beneath him, and had neither the funds to
continue Jonson’s pension, nor was he in the sentimental mood
to appoint a successor upon his death. It would have been
cruel mockery indeed for any poet to rhyme his praise.</p>

<p>The ten years in which Cromwell rode rough shod over
every established order of things did not develop a spirit that
called for poetry. Life was too hazardous to incline any to
sing in joyous strain. But when he died and no Independent
rose to fill his place, Charles II. was called to the throne, and
the House Of Stuart once more held the reins of government
securely, and the citizens called for a knightly laureate.</p>

<p>Sir William Davenant assumed the position of versifier for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the king. He was the son of a wealthy vinter who kept the
Crown Inn at Oxford, where Shakspere always stopped, who,
by the way, was such an ardent admirer of Mrs. D’Avenaunt
that her son bore his name, and it was the quiet boast of Sir
William that he was the natural son of the great dramatist.</p>

<p>He was early attached to the household of the gorgeous
Duchess of Richmond as a page, and later attached himself to
the retinue of Lord Brooke, until that nobleman was murdered,
which affliction threw Davenant upon his own resources,
which induced him to try his hand at versifying, but without
success until one of those periodic freaks of Ben Jonson led
the great poet to quarrel with the court architect, who in the
emergency discovered Davenant and gave him the opportunity
to secure the position on limited literary capital.</p>

<p>There was that in his nature which made him an active partisan,
and during the Long Parliament he was imprisoned for
scheming to seduce the army and overthrow the Commons.
He escaped, was captured and reimprisoned, escaped the second
time and fled to France, where he joined the exile queen
and served the cause of royalty by smuggling military stores
into England, and for personal bravery in the army of the
Earl of Newcastle, who espoused the queen’s cause, he was
knighted. After the fatal battle of Naseby he returned to
France and assumed the management of the colonization society
and sailed for Virginia, but his vessel was captured by a
parliamentary man-of-war and he imprisoned on the Isle of
Wight, and afterward sent to the Tower on the charge of high
treason. The timely interference of his old poet friend, Milton,
who had espoused the Puritan cause, alone prevented his
being beheaded. This successful importunity of an old friend
was in many ways most gratifying to Davenant, who, a few
years later, when Charles II. was called to assume the reins of
government and executed vengeance on all old time enemies,
dooming Milton to sudden execution, was privileged to reciprocate
the favor, and by timely intercession, recounting the
service the poet had been to him, saved Milton from the fatal
consequences of his political affiliations.</p>

<p>After Milton secured Davenant’s release from imprisonment
the humbled courtier endeavored to win an honorable living
as a poet, but in vain. He could only write dramas, but the
Puritans had closed the theaters with a rigor that knew no exception.
It was in this emergency that the knight whose experiences
had been so varied did the one bright thing of his life:
he succeeded in writing inoffensive plays, and having them
acted by calling them <i>operas</i>, thus pacifying the ruling public, at
the same time giving the world a new name for a diluted drama.</p>

<p>Charles II. when in power rewarded the faithfulness and
loyalty of Davenant by crowning him laureate. It has been
truthfully but cruelly said that there is not a more hopelessly
faded laurel on the slopes of the English Parnassus than that
which once flourished around Davenant’s grotesque head. Of
the brighter man who followed him another chapter must account.</p>

<h2 id="CHRISTMAS_DANGERS_AND_CHRISTMAS_HINTS">CHRISTMAS DANGERS AND CHRISTMAS HINTS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY HELEN CAMPBELL.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Not that involved in the old saying, “A green Yule makes a
fat churchyard,” nor even a hint at what Christmas cramming
for both children and their elders may include. The physical
results of either case are but a small portion of the evil that
year by year has grown, so silently, so unsuspected, that to
name evil in connection with the day seems both a misnomer
and an outrage.</p>

<p>Is it climate or temperament, or simple inherited tendency
that makes a golden mean impossible to the average American?
A combination probably, combinations being the one
thing to be taken for granted in any analysis of causes in man
or nature. Life for Americans began in a reaction. Form
and ceremony had hampered thought and hindered growth,
and the earnest Puritan swept both aside once for all. A comfortable
certainty was his that the question had but one side.
His doxy was the only orthodoxy, and his doxy rejected
Christmas as popish and owning the mark of the scarlet
woman. We all know the joylessness, the somberness of
those early days, in which human struggle was the only aim;
never human delight or human pleasure in anything God had
made. And we know as well, beyond any need of outline
here, the sharp reaction from such numbing relief, and the
conviction coming more and more surely to the surface, that
enjoyment is as much our destiny as struggle, and that strength
for the one comes in full acceptance of all legitimate forms of
the other. But when enjoyment becomes a struggle, and we
find distracted men and exhausted women crying as the holidays
end, “Thank fortune Christmas is over with!” it seems
high time to inquire why the friend whose entrance was hailed
with acclamation suddenly appears in the character of the
old man of the sea.</p>

<p>Is it that this is true, or that we have made him such by our
own election, refusing him his rightful place, and forcing him
ourselves to the shoulders that need have borne no such burden?
We stagger under the responsibilities of this time that
should mean only the purest pleasure. We grow feverish and
anxious in paying a debt when free will offering alone has
any part in the real Christmas. Children count their presents
and are sad or sulky if tree or stocking hold one less than
those of the child across the way. Boys and girls value the
gift for the money it cost, and have learned such valuation
from fathers and mothers who have discussed their own gifts
from this standpoint. The spirit of bargaining possesses all;
to get the most for the least outlay; to make the sum expended
bring the utmost possible show. The counters are
piled with flaunting bric-a-brac—cheap imitation of articles
beyond the purse of the average buyer, and the woman whose
supply of dish-towels is renewed from old sheets and who has
not dared to buy book or photograph for a year, gives and receives
some senseless plaque or staring vase, and might even
resent a dozen dish-towels as quite out of harmony with the
spirit of Christmas. The children share the same feeling, and
if they make anything with their own hands, seek something
so flimsy and useless, that as quickly as may be it is quietly
tucked out of sight. And even where common sense has larger
play, the amount of what must be done has gained such proportions
that feverish hurry fills the days of preparation, and
utter exhaustion the days that follow.</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of Christmas,” a small and cynical boy
remarked not long ago. “It’s just a regular grab game, that’s
what it is. I know fellows that join three or four Sunday-schools
just for what they’ll get on the tree; and I know one
fellow that hired other fellows, because you see, he couldn’t
be everywhere at once, and when his name was called off they
just went up and got his things for him. What do you think
of that?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s pretty bad, but that isn’t the sort of Christmas
you have at home, Horace?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Ours is just the same, only not so many of us.
Gussie is mad if I don’t spend a lot, and says I’m mean, and
mamma says so too if papa’s present doesn’t suit her. I’m
sick of it. Why didn’t you give me anything last Christmas?
You always did before.”</p>

<p>The answer would make an article of itself, for as I listened
my soul burned within me, and when the child ended, with his
calculating little face turned up to mine, I spake with my
tongue, and in the end brought a new look into the grave, blue
eyes. To him as to too many of us, it had come to be the gift
and not the giver, the symbol, and not the fact behind it. This
is a one-sided presentation you will say, an arraignment undeserved
by many; and even if deserved, the saying which does
duty in so many directions, once more comes up: “What are
you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>What we must all do, if the day is not to be permanently
despoiled of all real significance and beauty, is at once to settle
absolutely into simpler lines. The same passive acceptance
of custom, that has doubled our work in all home directions
and made the multiplication of labor-saving machinery
merely a reason for an always increasing ratio of labor, operates
here also. A sensible writer in the <i>Christian Union</i>
not long ago remarked that in the days of our grandmothers it
was ten children to one ruffle, whereas now it was ten ruffles
to one child. So it has been with gifts, and the child of the
last generation who rejoiced in two or three, considers the
child of this defrauded with less than a dozen. Cheap toys,
soon destroyed; cheap books, cleaving from their binding in
a week; cheap candy, fair to see but slow poison to the eater—fill
the stockings and crowd the tree, when the same money
would have secured one well-made, perfect gift, worth the keeping
for a lifetime. Art in its new adaptations is beginning to
teach us the value of honest work, yet with an education which
has known flimsiness and tawdriness as the chief characteristic
of a child’s possessions, how hard is the transition to simplicity
and strength. That we have made such strides away
from old conditions is only another proof of the enormous recuperative
power, part of the birthright of every American,
who, born, it may be, in a log cabin, ends his days as an authorized
and accepted art critic. It is safe then to believe that
the mass of common sense people need only to consider the
bearings of the Christmas craze in its present workings to decide
that a change must come, and to take active measures
toward such change.</p>

<p>Necessarily, only women can bring about such change, for
it is on them that the chief burden of Christmas work has
fallen and will continue to fall. For each woman there must
be a pause and a well-considered determination as to both
amount and degree of effort and expenditure. Where there is
little money personal effort is the only substitute.</p>

<p>The numberless fashion magazines are filled at this season
with hints for Christmas gifts, some practical and helpful,
but more quite useless to limited purses. A few suggestions
as to home-made gifts are given here, the reader’s own fancy
and memory being trusted to fill out the list, which must necessarily
be a limited one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>A most useful present is a sofa pillow, covered with one of
those large, bright silk handkerchiefs which are found in gentlemen’s
furnishing stores. It may be of cardinal, old gold,
blue or olive green, to match the furniture, and must have a
darker border. If the corners are plain, a figure of a dog’s
head, an owl, or a spray may be outlined in one, with silk of
some contrasting hue. Stretch the handkerchief smoothly
over the silesia-covered pillow made of a suitable size, turn the
ornamented corner back and fasten around its edge, and fit a
piece of black velvet neatly in its place. The edge is finished
with a silk cord of the same color, and a bow to match is
placed on the velvet. The whole can be made in a day, and
is both effective and inexpensive. Pine needles or hops may
be used for filling the pillow, which may thus be more welcome
to an invalid friend.</p>

<p>In place of the handkerchief, some tastes might prefer the
crazy patch-work now so much in vogue. If so, the pieces
must be very small, and most of them of vivid colors. They
will bear any amount of embroidery in quaint designs; flowers,
fans and oddities, all on a small scale. Seams are joined with
feather-stitching in shaded silk.</p>

<p>As a companion-piece, a head rest goes very nicely. A strip
of wool in any desired color may be crocheted in the Afghan
stitch, and then dotted irregularly with the conventional palm-leaf,
in shaded silk, worked in cross-stitch. If made of linen,
the word “Rest” may be outlined in fancy letters—first traced
with a pencil—in crewel. A poppy with its leaves falling apart,
in place of a period after the word, is suggestive and pretty.</p>

<p>For a literary friend, or to stand by papa’s desk, a waste paper
basket may be made in a variety of ways. A lard pail of
large size may be covered with plush and lined with silk over
pasteboard, fitted separately to the sides and to the circular
bottom. If of olive tint, conceal the joining at the top by narrow
gilt lace, old gold cord or ribbon ruching, often decorating
one side with a spray of large crimson and buff roses, hollyhock
blossoms, daisies or sunflowers. These may be procured
in appliqué at any fancy store for from a half dollar to
three times that sum. It is much preferable, of course, to embroider
any fanciful pattern, or to paint a running vine, beginning
near the bottom and ending at the top after having encircled
the pail. Allowance in decoration must be made for
two hoops of old gold satin ribbon, one and a half inches wide,
tied in snug bows. Sunflowers are sometimes made with dark
brown French knots of silk for the center, and petals of narrow
yellow ribbon of several shades. These, cut a proper length,
are turned in and fastened with invisible stitches to the plush,
making an excellent similitude of this showy flower. These
blossoms admit of great skill in arranging and grouping.</p>

<p>The new-fashioned paper water pails are also used as waste
paper baskets, and are desirable on account of their lightness
and durability. Even a novice can decorate them most effectively.
Paint entire surface with dark shaded yellows and
browns, or pink deepening to crimson, and when dry trace on
this background a conventional trailing vine and a few loose
flowers, or red Christmas berries like the holly. They may be
copied from any pattern which strikes the fancy, color being
desired rather than minuteness of finish. The handle, if not
removed, must be wound with ribbon.</p>

<p>Presents of catch-alls or receptacles for the sewing room can
be similarly fashioned. A new way is as follows: Take a
crimson or parti-colored Japanese fan, remove the rivet holding
the sticks together and run a stout cord in its place; the
fan is then to be fastened over a pasteboard funnel of just the
right size and lined with solid colored paper of some pleasing
tint. Ribbon to match, an inch wide, must be woven in and
out the sticks close enough to cover the pasteboard, and just
above the bottom, in front, secure a drooping bow of two-inch
satin ribbon. A few dried oats and grass stitched into the
bow, making a tiny bouquet, take off the stiffness of the ornament.</p>

<p>Another receptacle for letters or manuscripts can be made
from a couple of plain palm-leaf fans. Cut off the handles
even with the edge of the fan and cover one side of each with
silk, fastened to the top and sides, and pleated or gathered at
the handle. They are lined with silesia, and sewed together
at the tips. The tops—where the handles were—are flared
apart for a distance of six or eight inches, and then are to be
joined two-thirds of the way from the bottom by bright-hued
taffeta ribbons, narrow enough to cross easily in small diamonds.
Finish with a cockade of the same ribbon where the
silk is pleated at the handles. Or the ribbon may be quilled
in a V-shaped way down the middle far enough to give the receptacle
a heart-shape. A smaller heart of velvet, crossed
with a straw-colored arrow in embroidery silk, is a pretty finish
for the left-hand corner, with a spray crossing diagonally behind
and above. This may be varied by having a diagonal
piece of velvet cross the front, or a band of the same near one
side, on which is painted, embroidered or appliquéd any
favorite design. The colors and arrangement admit of the
greatest latitude, and challenge the fancy of the worker.</p>

<p>But this is not the beginning of what may be made of fans,
for fanciful or useful presents. Here is a pretty design for a
wall pocket: Attach one, nearly open, to a piece of pasteboard not
quite its size; from another remove the rivet, insert a cord in
its place and tie tightly. Line with paper and thin silk outside
of that, and fasten the edges by invisible stitches to that attached
to the pasteboard, allowing it to curve outwardly sufficiently
to answer the purposes of a receptacle. Finish with a
bow.</p>

<p>A series of a dozen bright paper covered bamboo fans, arranged
to overlap each other, light up the dark corner of a
room on Christmas day, with a play of color of which the eye
never tires. These, or the ribbed fans, may be arranged with
their handles grouped together and fans diverging from the
corner of the ceiling on the sides and top, making an ornament
both brilliant and unique. In the same manner they
may be employed about the center-piece of a plain ceiling, or
in devices on the side walls from which to hang Christmas
banners, wreaths or mottoes. On a long side wall small fans
may be so grouped as to simulate an eagle, from the talons of
which depends a favorite motto.</p>

<p>In dressing a room for Christmas it is important to have all
the accessories bright and harmonious. If all the decorations
are Japanese, there are a thousand ways of using paper mats,
screens and pictures which will suggest themselves with a little
experimenting, and these are now everywhere easy to obtain.
The entire ceiling may be bordered with a frieze made
from a couple of Japanese picture books, which are merely
folded pictures several yards in length, when outstretched like
a panorama. A dollar’s worth of books will thus impart a
brilliancy which nothing else emulates, while the pendant
Christmas greens seem the richer by contrast. A few large
Chinese lanterns hung from the ceiling, wreathed with simple
vines, like princess pine, about the bottom, in addition, will
convert the plainest room into a kind of bower, peculiarly fitting
it for the festivities of the season. The uttermost parts of
the earth must yield up a tithe of all their glory, to aid in
illuminating the natal day of the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>For all parts of the dwelling, a thousand dainty devices are
easily made, suitable for presentation on that day. For the
dressing bureau, butcher’s cuffs of plaited grass are coarsely
embroidered in crewel, with design of rushes, grass, daisies or
poppies, springing from the bottom, which is filled in with a
circular piece of pasteboard covered with linen. Line with
crimson cloth. Scent bottles may be covered with painted
ribbon bags, or merely tied with satin ribbon, the ends of
which have each the favorite flower of the recipient, or a flower
on one and an initial on the other.</p>

<p>For the whisk-brush at the side of the bureau make a tight,
straight cover of crash or linen, embroidered or painted, edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with scallops bound with silk. This is drawn close about the
handle and tied with a narrow ribbon at the top, and is long
enough to come within two inches of the tip. Such a cover
will prove far more acceptable than the brush-holder which
has been so much used.</p>

<p>For splashers take fine, stiff linen, fitted to the space above the
washstand, and hemmed at the ends and sides. Trace lightly
with a lead pencil, lengthwise, any suitable pattern. It may
be made of irregular, horizontal lines, for water, on which are
outlined a duck floating or diving; large water lilies with their
graceful leaves and rushes at the edge. Then dissolve India
ink in a shallow dish of water, and with a new steel pen go
over the outline carefully, repeating where the shade deepens
till it is sufficiently heavy. The etching may be made very
handsome and striking with a little care; or, a conventional
morning-glory vine may obliquely cross the splasher. It is
fastened to the wall with minute tacks and a bow at the left-hand
upper corner.</p>

<p>Do we wish a table-scarf for a friend? It can be made of
felt, of one of the many shades of olive, on which decorations
are so well brought out. Line with silesia, and border the
ends with a broad band of plush. Finish with outline stitch
of contrasting colors, or with transfer-work of fine cretonne or
appliqué flowers, made of machine embroidery, to which reference
has been made. It is not generally known that felt
may be hand-painted in oil with a stiff brush, by the merest
novice. Have a large figured embroidery pattern stamped on
the felt to give a strong outline. Mix the colors thick and put
on with a bold touch. Large flowers or fruit, like blackberries,
are showy and effective here and resemble the softest
crewel-work at a little distance.</p>

<p>If the square covers are preferred, those hiding the entire
table, they are fringed by simply cutting the edges in strips a
quarter of an inch wide and six inches deep. Another fringe
made precisely the same way, of old gold felt with a narrow
heading, is merely tacked under the first, when the hue is olive
or wine color. Canton flannel table spreads can be finished
and decorated in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Mantel and window lambrequins are made according to the
same general plan, of felt, canton flannel, plush, or linen. If
the latter, they are embroidered with long stitches in patterns
of grass or sedge, daisies or crimson berries, or painted in
trailing figures of wild roses.</p>

<p>For a gentleman an umbrella case is always an acceptable
present. From a yard of strong, twilled linen, measure a
lengthwise strip ten inches wide at the top; taper it on each
side to six inches wide at the bottom. On this strip fit another
piece of the same linen, shorter and fuller, to give room for
two umbrellas. About the right size will make it three-quarters
of a yard long, fourteen inches wide at the top, and eight
inches at the bottom. Crease the latter lengthwise down the
middle; on one side of this crease, outline in black silk the
shape of a closed umbrella, ribs, handle and folds, and on the
other a smaller sun umbrella. On the upper section of the
foundation copy in the same manner figures taken from the
Greenaway books. A pleasing device is a couple of children,
merrily trudging along in the rain, each under an open umbrella.
Then stitch the center of the embroidered strip to the
center of the foundation, after laying two pleats in the tip of
the shorter and wider strip, so as to make them of the same
width. Run the sides and bottoms together, after lining the
foundation, and bind the whole with black braid. Attach two
strong loops to the top to suspend from hooks.</p>

<p>For the little ones naught can come amiss. Stockings of
coarse white lace, with slipper tips of blue or pink, and a
dainty knot of ribbon in front; all sorts of fancy ornaments
made of stiff paper and covered with gold and silver paper;
cornucopias, boxes and toys without end—their variety and
name are legion. A pretty bon-bon receptacle is made in this
way: Take a square of silk measuring from eighteen to
twenty-seven inches, of any color desired—a bright handkerchief
will do—and mark within it a perfect circle small enough
to be three inches from the middle of the sides. Make a shirr
at this mark, in which draw two ribbons in such a manner as to
pull together like a work-bag. Trim the edge with black or
white lace, and you have a beautiful bag, after the bon-bons
are gone. If you choose to give a unique finish it is easily
done. Soak your own photograph in water long enough to
remove the picture from the back; dry carefully, and gum to

<p>So much for gifts and home decorations, the list of which
might be indefinitely extended. The Christmas dinner is always
a matter of study—to the young housekeeper sometimes
despair. Let it be remembered that on that day everyone from
the children to the grandmother has nibbled at candies and
nuts, and all tempting Christmas sweets, and that, even if the
richest of mince pies and plum puddings seem none too good
for the occasion, a simpler dessert of delicate blanc-manges
or jellies will leave the eater a clearer head than the
heavier mixtures. Two menus are given, one under protest
and elaborate enough for the most persistent believer in many
courses; the other far simpler, and quite possible for even the
young housekeeper, who is ambitious to show what she can
do. So many admirable cook-books are now before the public
that it seems invidious to mention any special one. But the
writer, who some years ago had occasion to examine carefully
one hundred and forty-three, finds that where many have done
excellently, one recent one embodies most perfectly their best
features. It is the Boston Cooking School and its director,
Mrs. Lincoln, to whom we owe this most admirably planned
book, in which every receipt has been personally tested. Mrs.
Ewing may be depended upon also as an authority, and there
is a compact little manual known as “The Easiest Way in
Housekeeping and Cooking,” which has brought to its author
scores of letters from the housekeepers who have found it a
friend. In any of these books accurate rules will be found for
the dishes given in both menus.</p>

<p>For a family where the mistress must do all with her own
hands, omit the soup and at least one vegetable in the second
menu. It would be wisdom also to substitute for the rich pudding
a mould of blanc-mange or lemon jelly, but these are matters
of personal decision.</p>

<p>The home dinner decided upon, every woman will remember
the poorer homes where festivity can never be possible,
save as the means for it come from others. It is easy to find
ways of adding some unaccustomed luxury—a little fruit, some
nuts and raisins, or perhaps even the turkey itself to the table
of some hard-working, self-respecting head of a family, who
finds the dollars always too few, yet asks favors of no man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Often a little coöperation would secure a good Christmas dinner
to many who alone would be unable to buy it. By settling
upon how much can be spent, and giving the sum to some authorized
buyer, wholesale prices may often be had. To accomplish
this for half a dozen poor families in a given neighborhood,
would often be truer charity than any giving, and pave
the way to coöperation in other ways. On no other day of the
three hundred and sixty-five can we answer as readily the
question, “Who is my neighbor?” as on this one sacred to
love, both human and divine, and demanding love as its highest
expression. There may be no time for any elaborate
church service, to which a morning must be given, but evening
if not morning should hold some assembling together, and
in a neighborhood where many poor, or workers in factories
or mills are to be found, a simple entertainment—play, charade,
light concert, or stereopticon might well have its opening
word, thoughtful and tender, of the Christ-child; his love
for every weary and toiling child of earth, and his joy in their
joy. Where there is no such population there is no less need
of a general as well as a special assembling. In short, by
judicious planning, it will be possible not only to cover all
necessary ground of home pleasure in the day, but to make
part also of such evening entertainment as may seem good.
A church dinner has been given, made up of prepared food
sent in by various members, all that remained being taken
home by the eaters. Each year has had its suggestions for
Christmas pleasure for the poor always with us, and at such a
season denominational differences slip out of sight, and counsel
can satisfactorily be taken together by the working members
of all churches. Union festivals have already proved
successful, and may be perfected still more in detail, the
warmth of this joint action for a common good lasting long
beyond the day of its accomplishment. If the day has its dangers
it holds also its delights, and may be more and more the
occasion for the sweetest and tenderest thought and labor
that we have to give—a never-failing spring of pleasure to
every soul who knows its real meaning and works toward a
fulfillment of that meaning.</p>

<h2 id="DO_ANIMALS_FEIGN_DEATH">DO ANIMALS FEIGN DEATH?</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY M. ROMANES.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center smaller">Translated for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> from the <i>Révue Scientifique</i>.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>It is a well known fact that animals belonging to different orders
and even to different classes, manifest, when they are in
danger, the instinct of feigning death. As it is evidently impossible
to attribute this to any idea of death, and a conscious
simulation of it on the part of the animals, the subject acquires
importance, and merits our consideration. I will cite briefly
some facts I have been able to gather, and will then attempt
some explanation.</p>

<p>The most familiar examples of the instinct in question are
furnished by various sorts of insects and spiders, many of
which will allow themselves to be torn limb from limb, or to be
burned until death follows, without making the least movement.
“Among fishes the captured sturgeon often remains
motionless and passive in the net, while the perch seems to be
dead and floats upon its back.” Wrangle tells us that the wild
geese of Liberia, if they are disturbed during their moulting
season, when they are unable to fly, will stretch themselves out
upon the ground and appear lifeless, thus deceiving the hunter.
According to Couch, the same thing occurs among crakes,
larks, and other birds. Of mammals the same author says:
“The opossum of North America is so celebrated for its pretense
of death that its name has passed into proverb for expressing
this kind of deception,” He also gives examples of
the same fact noticed among mice, squirrels, and weasels,
while those told of wolves and foxes are so numerous that I
think no one can reasonably doubt their truth. Captain Lyon,
in the narration of his expedition to the North Pole, says that a
wolf was one day caught in a trap, and, supposing it to be
dead, they dragged it on board. After awhile, as it lay
stretched out on deck, some one noticed that it moved its eyes
every time any object passed near it. They thought best then
to take some precautions; its limbs were bound, and they put
it in such a position as to leave its head without support. To
their great surprise it soon made a vigorous bound toward those
who were near by, and then tried to reach back and bite off
the rope which held it. There are many examples on record
of foxes assuming the appearance of death. Mr. Blyth says:
“A fox was once known, when it was surprised in a poultry
yard, to lie as if dead; it let them drag it out by the tail and
cast it upon a compost heap; but, that done, it sprang to its
feet and sped away with all possible haste.”</p>

<p>This high degree of simulation and dissimulation has been
attributed to the sagacity of the animals, which, when they do
not see any better means of escape, leads them to seem to be
incapable of defending themselves, or fleeing, until they have
disarmed all suspicions, and thus caused all hostile efforts
toward them to cease.</p>

<p>According to Jesse, even serpents will feign death and remain
motionless as long as any one is watching them, but
when they think their enemies have withdrawn and all danger
is passed, they will make a rapid escape. The author
of a “Natural History of Birds” relates that at one time a
crake was brought by a dog to his master. The gentleman
turned it over with his foot as it lay upon the ground, and convinced
himself that it was dead. After a time, however, he
saw it open one eye; he picked it up, but again it had all the
appearance of a dead bird. He put it in his pocket, and after
a few minutes he felt it flutter. He examined it a third time,
but discovered no signs of life. He then placed it on the
ground and withdrew to a little distance in order to watch it.
At the end of about five minutes the bird raised its head with
precaution, looked around, and then took itself off in the liveliest
manner imaginable.</p>

<p>Bingley says: “This strategem, as it appears, is employed
by the common crab, which, when it apprehends danger, remains
motionless, waiting an opportunity to bury itself in the
sand.”</p>

<p>The subject claims serious attention, because, on one side,
as has been said above, it is evident that the conscious simulation
of death implies the possession of a faculty more elevated
than any that we know belonging even to the most intelligent
animals; on the other side, it is not easy to explain these
facts on any other basis. Couch offers the following: “A very
reasonable explanation is, that the suddenness of the encounter
with man in an unexpected moment, results in its stupefaction,
or throws the animal into such a state that it can not make
an effort to flee. The appearance of death is not a ruse with it;
it is the consequence of its terror. It is said, if a wolf falls
into a ditch the surprise is so great, and deprives him of his
powers to such an extent that a man can descend to his side
without fear. Also, whenever a wolf loses its way in a strange
country, it loses, beside, much of its courage, and can be attacked
with impunity.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to find a weasel asleep, or not thoroughly on
its guard, but what seems least likely of all is that a weasel
would allow itself to be rolled over, played with, and tossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
up by a cat. It happened once, however, that while a cat was
tranquilly stretched out, a weasel passed by; it was caught in
the twinkling of an eye and carried toward the house, situated
at quite a little distance away. The door being shut, the cat,
deceived by the apparent lifeless condition of its victim,
dropped it upon the sill and mewed, as was its custom, for
some one to open the door. But at that moment the senses of
the alert little creature returned, and it set its teeth into the
nose of its enemy. It is probable that, beside itself with surprise
at its capture, the manner in which the cat held it by its
back had prevented it from making any resistance whatever
before that moment; for in catching them up in this manner,
our little quadrupeds, that bite so ferociously, can be held
without fear of being wounded. But one can scarcely think
that the weasel had the intention of deceiving the cat all the
time it was in its mouth. This hypothesis would need to be
supported by special tests before meriting acceptance.</p>

<p>The tests should consist in permitting the animal, as soon as
it feigned death, to regain its liberty, and in watching it without
its knowledge. If for any length of time it remained motionless,
the fact would support the theory of Couch. Instead
of this, if it very soon sprang up and tried to escape it would
seem necessary to decide that it voluntarily and consciously
assumed that appearance.</p>

<p>I thought once I had found an opportunity for making a
test of this question, and perhaps for arriving at some satisfactory
explanation of this seeming deception on the part of animals.
Having entrapped a squirrel I noticed that it immediately
became motionless. I took it out of the trap and placed
it on the ground, then concealed myself and watched long
enough for it to recover itself; but as it did not stir I went to examine
it, and found that it was really dead. This incident supports
the hypothesis of Couch, for it shows that terror may be
sufficient to cause the death of an animal.</p>

<p>Professor Preyer attributes exclusively to catalepsy this lifeless
appearance in insects. Having observed the power of
this disease to produce a similar condition in the system of the
higher animals, he logically concludes that the same cause
must bring about the same effect in all animals. On the other
hand, for I do not wish to shun the difficult sides of the question,
there are facts going to show that some monkeys feign
death deliberately, not to escape from enemies, but to mislead
their presumptive victims. Here it becomes necessary to seek
some other explanation. Dr. Bryden says that certain monkeys
having observed crows gathering around the carcass of
a monkey, may have concluded that by becoming motionless
they might induce them to come within their reach. Without
doubt this presupposes a high degree of intelligence, but
it does not imply an abstract idea of death, but rather only the
idea of imitating an object already remarked, with the desire
of bringing about a similar result.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of the probability that this strange action on
the part of the higher animals is due to catalepsy, there is a
possibility that it may be the result of an intelligent design.</p>

<p>The following incident published by G. Bidie seems rather
to substantiate the latter hypothesis.</p>

<p>“Some years ago, when I was living in the western part of
Mysore, India, I occupied a house surrounded by several acres
of good pasturage. The fine turf of this enclosure tempted
the cattle, and whenever the gates were open they did not fail
to make an entrance. My servants did their best to keep out
the intruders; but one day they came to me, deeply troubled,
saying that a Brahmin bull which they had struck, had fallen
down dead. I will remark in passing that these bulls are
sacred and privileged animals which are allowed to roam at
will. Upon hearing that the marauder was dead I went immediately
to see him; there he lay, stretched out, to all appearances
stone dead. Uneasy enough over the circumstance
which would be very apt to stir up enemies against me, I returned
to the house with the intention of going to acquaint the
authorities of the district with the affair; but presently some
one came running up and joyously informed me that he was
upon his feet quietly browsing in the field. Suffice it to say
that he was in the habit of feigning death, which rendered his
expulsion practically impossible, every time he found himself
in a pasture which pleased him, and from which he did not
wish to be turned away. This ruse was repeated several times,
and although very amusing at first, we at length grew tired of
it. So one day when he was lying as if dead I ordered the
cook to bring a pan of live coals, and placed it near him. At
first he paid no attention, but as the heat began to increase, he
slowly raised his head, looked sharply at the coals a moment,
sprang to his feet, and leaped over the fence with the agility of
a stag. That was the last time he honored us with his presence.”</p>

<p>The idea of the animal might have been only to resist expulsion
by opposing its whole weight to any efforts made in
that direction. The case however is remarkable, and I prefer
not to express an opinion in favor of either hypothesis. I hope
only to provoke experimental researches, which can be made
by any one who will take the occasion so to do.</p>

<p>The experiments of Professor Darwin in regard to insects
and spiders put it out of the question that these creatures
adopt as a ruse this appearance of death, or act with any design
in the matter. The facts as regards animals higher in the
scale of life call, on the other hand, for some different conclusion;
but before this can be reached further research must be
made, and other facts added to those already known.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WAR_DEPARTMENT">THE WAR DEPARTMENT.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY OLIVER W. LONGAN.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The word “department,” as used in connection with the
principal divisions through or by which the executive affairs of
the government are administered, has very little if any significance,
because it applies as well to the smallest subdivisions
as to the three coördinate powers of our republic. Still
another use was given it by a candidate for government appointment
who, in response to a requirement of the Civil Service
Commission to name the three great departments of the
government, introduced a new application of the word by
writing, “the Republican, the Democratic, and the Independent.”
And so with the name “War Department,” its use applies
it with equal propriety to the organization which administers
the military affairs of the government and to the building
in which its offices are located, just as the word church
applies to the building and to the society of people which worships
in it.</p>

<p>The War Department is one (the third in point of classification)
of the seven divisions of the executive branch of the government
whose chief officers form the President’s cabinet. It
comprises, beside the office of the Secretary of War, ten minor
divisions called “staff departments,” or “bureaus,” each under
the direction of an officer who holds the rank and position of a
brigadier-general in the United States army, and including a
military force of officers of the several ranks from captain up
to colonel, some of whom are on duty in the offices in Washington,
but a majority performing the duties appertaining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
their respective bureaus at military posts, or at the headquarters
of the military geographical departments and divisions, or
elsewhere as they may be directed by the Secretary of War.
Each bureau has also a force of civilian employes who perform
the clerical duties of the department under the direction of
their respective officers. The clerks are divided into grades
as follows, the salaries being determined by the grades: Chief
clerks, $2,000; clerks, class four, $1,800; class three, $1,600;
class two, $1,400; class one, $1,200; clerks, $1,000; copyists,
$900; the other employes being messengers, assistant messengers,
watchmen, mechanics, laborers, etc. The names of the
subdivisions are the Adjutant-General’s, the Inspector General’s,
the Judge Advocate-General’s, the Quartermaster’s, the
Subsistence, the Medical, the Pay, and the Ordnance Departments,
the Corps of Engineers and the Signal Corps. The
business of these bureaus will be mentioned in their order.</p>

<p>During the first year of the revolutionary war, and before the
colonists had abandoned all hope that their difficulties with the
mother country might be settled by a just recognition of their
rights as English subjects, the colonial army under Washington
was directed by the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.
Ten days prior to the first anniversary of the battle of Bunker
Hill, a resolution to absolve all allegiance to the British crown
was introduced in Congress, and five days thereafter a resolution
was adopted to appoint a “Board of War and Ordnance,”
to consist of five members of the Congress, to be organized as
a war office which was to be the channel for military correspondence
and orders, and an office of record to which the
officers commanding in the army were required to send reports
of the condition and disposition of troops. Washington wrote
in reply to a dispatch from the President of the Congress, informing
him of the institution of the board, that it “is certainly
an event of great importance, and in all probability will
be recorded as such in the historic page.” As a beginning it
possesses the interest to us to-day which attaches to all our
institutions whose history can be traced up to the present degree
of efficiency and finished organization which we regard
with such pride and satisfaction, and which brings the feeling
of security we enjoy in the midst of the most trying times of
uncertainty. After a little more than one year of administration
of military affairs by the Board of War and Ordnance as
an advisory committee to Congress, a new organization was
made called the “Board of War,” consisting of three persons
not members of the Congress, and the number was soon afterward
increased to five members, who are frequently mentioned
in the resolutions pertaining to the conduct of the war as Commissioners
of the War Office, and the board is sometimes mentioned
under the old, and sometimes under the new name. A
review of the instructions and resolves of Congress to the board,
and through it to the army, making regulations, appointing
committees, creating offices for the control of supplies, money
and war material, conferring or restricting authority and responsibility,
reveals the character of the times and the inexperience
of men better than the history of their individual acts
can do it, and increases the marvel that success was ever
reached through such apparent confusion; but it must have
been a grand period for men who did not hesitate to undertake
and plan and execute without the aid of “precedent,” that potent
influence which gives shape to a large proportion of executive
administration to-day. But the time approached when
the question of national organization must be settled, and
although the prospect at the time (early in 1781) appeared to
afford no more promise of final success than at any time during
the struggle there seemed to be an intuition which led to a
disposition of military affairs, so that the details might be
gradually relinquished by the Congress to the charge of one
executive officer in addition to the Commander-in-Chief whose
authority was never curtailed by a department up to the hour
he returned his commission to the body which had conferred
it upon him. Early in 1781 the Congress undertook a plan for
the establishment of executive departments, and one of the
offices created was that of “Secretary at War”—notice the
preposition—with powers similar to those of the “Board of
War,” but enlarged in their scope, and released in a measure
from supervisory direction. The board continued to act, however,
for several months, probably because the Congress was
unable to select the right man to fill the new office, but on the
30th of October, 1781, the officer who, ten days before, had received
the sword of the defeated British general at Yorktown,
was elected Secretary at War. The coincidence of surnames
justifies the remark here that the first Secretary at War and
the present Secretary of War bear the same. Step by step for
a few succeeding years the duties and powers of the office were
specifically defined by legislation, but at such intervals as to
make the rules appear fragmentary, until on the 27th of January,
1785, a revision was made and all the loose lines were
gathered into one instrument, which had for its enacting clause,
“<i>Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled</i>,”
and directed the Secretary at War to “keep a public and convenient
office in the place where Congress shall reside,” and
that office for the first time was dignified with the name
“Department of War.” The resolves of Congress began also
to take the form of instructions to the Secretary at War to issue
his orders to the army, thus indirectly raising his position in
the scale of authority and control to one not yet specifically
recognized. An even administration follows until the end of
the confederation and the new organization of executive departments
under the constitution of the United States. A report
made to Congress October 2, 1788, by a committee which
had been appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the business
of the Department of War, shows that the number of
employes then in the department was four, whose aggregate
annual compensation was $1,500. To-day the force of more
than fifteen hundred employes, receiving the gross sum of
$1,820,830, makes a notable contrast, and indicates the volume
of increase in the business and the wonderful change of
values.</p>

<p>The new government, under the constitution, went into operation
practically on the 30th of April, 1789, when Washington
was inaugurated at the old City Hall in New York as the
first President of the United States, and became the “commander-in-chief
of the army and navy.” The first act of Congress
relating to military affairs, to be approved by him, was
the act of August 7, 1789, which directed “that there shall be
an executive department, to be denominated the Department
of War; and that there shall be a principal officer therein to be
called the Secretary for the Department of War.” This officer
was to perform such duties as the President should direct
relating to military commissions, land or naval forces, ships,
or warlike stores, or Indian affairs, or the granting of bounty
lands, or “such other matters respecting military or naval
affairs as the President of the United States shall assign to
said department.” He was also authorized to appoint a chief
clerk, who in the event of the removal of the Secretary, or the
occurrence of a vacancy, should have charge of the records,
books, and papers of the department (naval affairs, public
lands, Indian affairs, and pensions were afterward transferred
to other departments).</p>

<p>The title of “Secretary of War” appears to have been
adopted as a matter of choice by the first Secretary appointed
by Washington, the only change from the old title, it will be
noticed, being the use of the preposition <i>of</i> for <i>at</i>, a change
which we will agree could not to-day be reversed without provoking
a liberal amount of criticism, both serious and humorous,
if judgment may be taken from the notice universally
given to trifling matters for the purpose of seasoning the news
as we season our food, to give it a relish which an educated
but not always cultivated taste demands.</p>

<p>During a period of years succeeding the establishing of the
War Department, up to the war of 1812, it appeared to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
agency, simple in organization and limited in authority, which
is rarely mentioned in legislative acts, for it is a notable fact
that the acts of Congress during this period relating to military
affairs were almost all addressed to the President of the
United States. Time and the progress of events brought to
the Department other and more important matters than the
clerical work of correspondence and keeping records, and the
work not only of obtaining and preserving all manner of army
supplies, but of providing for their production, led to the establishment
of minor agencies, each one as it was brought into
existence, adding to the functions of the Secretary of War,
and giving him a superior directing authority. These agencies
became subordinate to the War Department, but were liable
to and did share with the army in the legislation which
from time to time created or disbanded the active forces as the
circumstances required. The departmental divisions of business
were continued, however, and when one and another of
the offices which corresponded with our present staff departments
were discontinued the duties were maintained by provisional
means until they were restored, or others of similar
nature were created to take their places. In the course of time
the bureaus became permanently established, and formed the
links which connected the War Department, a civil office, with
the army, and the Secretary of War, whose position in the beginning
was simply that of an agent of the President for the
administration of military affairs has come to be recognized as
holding discretionary power and authority, although no change
has taken place in his relations to the President on the one
hand, or to the army on the other, except that in later years
the laws and resolves of Congress relating to the business
which he administers are addressed to him directly, instead of
to the President, as in former years.</p>

<p>The interval which we must make here in the history of the
department might be filled with items indicating its place and
power during the period omitted, but the line of progress has
been direct, and regularly approaching the condition which
makes it possible at any time to accelerate its operations for
the prosecution of active warfare, or to permit them to sink to
the dream of peace, without, in either case, disturbing the perfect
system of business.</p>

<p>That portion of the business of the War Department transacted
under the immediate direction of the Secretary of War
and the chief clerk of the Department, comprises divisions of
records, correspondence, requisitions and accounts, advertising
accounts, miscellaneous supplies, and connected therewith
is a library of about sixteen thousand five hundred volumes,
from which any employe of the Department may obtain books
for temporary use. No proper idea of the business can be
given in a written description without taking too much space
for this article. As the central office of the Department, and
having direction of the affairs of the several bureaus, all important
matters connected therewith pass through it for the action
of the Secretary.</p>

<p>The Adjutant-General now has charge of the records which
in the early days were received and preserved in the War Office.
He publishes all orders and conducts all correspondence
from the Secretary of War and the commanding General to
the army, issues appointments and commissions, receives, records
and arranges for use and preservation rolls, reports and
other official papers pertaining to the personal history of every
officer and soldier in the army, from the day of appointment
or enlistment up to the date the service ceases, from whatever
cause; has charge of the business pertaining to the military
academy, the military prisons, the recruiting service, the military
reservations, and the records of bureaus and commands
which existed during the war of the rebellion, and have since
been discontinued; and from the records in his department
the information necessary to the settlement of pension and
other claims of officers and soldiers, of whatever nature, growing
out of their service, is furnished.</p>

<p>The duties under the Inspector-General are the inspection of
military posts and troops, particularly with reference to material,
supplies, disbursing accounts, and any matters connected
with the military establishment or pertaining to military laws
or regulations upon which reports or advice may be required
by the Department for the promotion of discipline, the proper
performance of duty, or the reformation of abuses.</p>

<p>The Judge Advocate-General receives, reviews and records
the proceedings of all military trials, and furnishes reports
and information therefrom whenever required, and gives opinions
upon such questions of law as may be referred to him by
the Department.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster’s Department is charged with the duty of
furnishing transportation for troops, materials of all kinds, and
all supplies; horses for cavalry and artillery; all camp and
garrison equipage, forage, fuel and buildings; in a word, all
manner of supplies except food, medicines, arms, and ammunition.
The national cemeteries are under charge of the officers
of this department.</p>

<p>The Subsistence Department provides all the food for the
army, being charged with the duty of purchasing, distributing
and issuing to all the stations occupied by troops. It also
keeps in store for sale to officers many articles of regular supply
not included in the ration table. The office of the Commissary-General
of Subsistence occupies the building half a
square north of the Treasury Department, in which Mr. Seward
lived when he was Secretary of State under President Lincoln,
and where the attempt was made to take his life on the
same night the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>The Pay Department is just what its name indicates. From
its officers every person in the military service, from the commanding
General to the recruit receives his salary or pay. All
persons in government employ immediately connected with the
army, who are not paid by the Quartermaster’s Department,
receive their pay from the Pay Department.</p>

<p>The Medical Department, under the direction of the Surgeon-General,
is charged with the care of the sick and
wounded, and for this purpose procures all medicines, medical
and surgical appliances, and other supplies appertaining to
that special branch of the service. It is also an office of record,
receives reports of all cases of disease, wounds or injury
in the army, and furnishes information therefrom upon claims
for pensions. It also furnishes artificial limbs to persons entitled
to them, or pays a commutation in lieu thereof, to those
who prefer it. The Department has collected a library of sixty-five
thousand seven hundred bound volumes, forty-seven thousand
pamphlets, and thirty-eight thousand dissertations upon
subjects pertaining to the medical profession, which, with a
medical museum of great value, occupies the building in which
President Lincoln was assassinated.</p>

<p>The Corps of Engineers is a distinct arm of the service as
well as a division of the War Department, and enjoys the distinction
of an organization since 1802, when it was constituted
the Military Academy, and held its connection with it for more
than sixty years. Among the duties performed by the corps
are the construction of sea coast defenses, fortifications, survey
and construction of river and harbor improvements, geographical
and lake surveys, and any other duties in the line of engineering,
whether connected with the military establishment
or not, to which its officers may be assigned by competent authority.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department is charged with duties appertaining
exclusively to the military establishment, the manufacture
and storage of every description of gun or firearm, large or
small, and of all kinds of warlike weapons, projectiles, and
ammunition; of all equipments pertaining to the artillery arm
of the service; with the experimental tests of all improved
guns, and with the care of armories and arsenals. The injunction
“in time of peace prepare for war” is practically
heeded by this department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The Signal Corps is an organization of comparatively recent
date, but well known through the daily reports of indications
or probabilities of the weather. In time of war the duties of
the corps have been the transmission of messages by signal
flags, colored lights, or the telegraph. In time of peace the
instruction of officers and men in the use of signals and the
telegraph and the construction of field telegraph lines is carried
on. The limited space allowed for this article will not admit
of a description of the service in connection with the observations
of the weather, but these observations will be made
the subject of a future article.</p>

<p>All the subordinate departments which are charged with the
purchase of supplies have, as the Pay Department also has,
the disbursement of very large appropriations, and the accountability
for the funds and the property obtained is
under a perfect system, governed by regulations which apply
equally to all. The reports and returns pertaining thereto,
which are made monthly and quarterly, are first examined in
the bureaus of the War Department, and are then transferred
to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, where
they are finally audited and settled.</p>

<p>The present home of the War Department is in the new
granite building known as the “State, War, and Navy Building,”
immediately west of, and about the length of one square
from the President’s mansion. The Department occupies the
north wing, and will occupy the west and court-yard wings
when completed. These “wings” are the divisions of the
building, which form four sides, as four complete buildings
might be placed to form a rectangle, with a large court in the
center which is intersected by the fifth or court-yard wing.
The whole area covered by the building, its approaches and
courts is nearly four and one half acres. The cost of the completed
portion has been about eight and one half million dollars.
The office of the Secretary of War, and a portion of the
office of the Adjutant-General is all that has yet found permanent
quarters in the building, the east wing occupied by the Navy
Department, and the south wing by the State Department. A full
description of the structure may be postponed till its completion.</p>

<h2 id="MILTON_AS_THE_POETS_POET">MILTON AS THE POETS’ POET.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM CLEAVER WILKINSON.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>On the illuminated calendar of the C. L. S. C. appears this
month the illustrious name of Milton. There remains hardly
anything at the same time new and true to be said of the author
of “Paradise Lost.” It has, however, occurred to me
that the members of our ever widening Circle might be glad
to see what a rich garland he wears as poets’ poet. This title
has at different times been given to several different English
names. Spenser was perhaps the first to receive it. Milton
deserves it not less than Spenser. More, perhaps—for beside
being a favorite poet with poets, Milton has happened also to be
made the subject of poetical description and ascription beyond,
as I should suppose, the fortune of any rival whatever.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be interesting, if not instructive, to gather
here into a sheaf some of the laurels that have thus been
wreathed around the brow of Milton by the laureate company
of the poets since his day. The subject will be poetry, and
poetry, too, will be the main part of the discussion.</p>

<p>Of course there is no way but to begin with Dryden’s famous
hexastich:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Three poets in three distant ages born</div>
<div class="verse">Greece, Italy, and England did adorn;</div>
<div class="verse">The first in loftiness of thought surpassed;</div>
<div class="verse">The next in majesty; in both the last.</div>
<div class="verse">The force of nature could no further go;</div>
<div class="verse">To make a third, she joined the other two.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The foregoing is not very good poetry, but it is very good
epigram, as might have been expected—for Dryden is a master
epigrammatist, if but an indifferent poet. Do not scrutinize
the present epigram too nicely, and how admirable it is!
The last two lines are the gist of it. What precedes is only
preparation for these two. Necessary preparation, but as criticism,
not ideal. For though “loftiness of thought,” answering
for sublimity, may doubtfully do to stand as the chief characteristic
of Homer, and though Virgil’s quality may fairly
well be expressed in the single word “majesty,” these two
things, conceived as different from one another, can not be
said to compose together the character of Milton. Milton surpasses
in sublimity, no doubt, and he is surpassingly majestic;
but you would hardly balance the one attribute against the
other to express summarily his complement of qualities. The
two attributes, sublimity and majesty, resemble each other too
much to be good antitheses. But this paper is not to be a criticism.</p>

<p>Let us have a sharp contrast next. Gray in his ode on the
“Progress of Poets:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nor second he,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">(The poet means not second to Shakspere, whom he has
just celebrated)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">Nor second he, that rode sublime</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the seraph wings of ecstacy</div>
<div class="verse">The secrets of the abyss to spy.</div>
<div class="verse i2">He passed the flaming bounds of place and time,</div>
<div class="verse">The living throne, the sapphire blaze,</div>
<div class="verse">Where angels tremble while they gaze,</div>
<div class="verse">He saw; but blasted with excess of light</div>
<div class="verse">Closed his eyes in endless night.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gray’s method is nowhere better exemplified than in this resplendent
tribute to Milton. The very terms in which he glorifies
his subject are with fine adaptation borrowed from that subject
himself. The coincidence upon which here we chance is too
good to be disregarded. Let us digress enough to bring in
Gray’s sympathetically varied characterization of Dryden
which immediately follows in the text of the ode:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Behold where Dryden’s less presumptuous care</div>
<div class="verse">Wide o’er the fields of glory bear</div>
<div class="verse">Two coursers of ethereal race</div>
<div class="verse">With necks in thunder clothed, and long resounding pace.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The equaling of Milton with Shakspere by Gray reminds of
Tennyson in his “Palace of Art:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And there was Milton, like a seraph strong,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Beside him</i> Shakspere bland and mild.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Tennyson has something more elaborate on Milton.
This happens to be in one of his experimental pieces. Trying
that master hand of his—turned “’prentice” on this occasion—at
alcaics, a meter not often attempted in English, he makes Milton
his inspiration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O mighty-mouthed inventor of harmonies,</div>
<div class="verse">O skill’d to sing of Time or Eternity,</div>
<div class="verse i2">God-gifted organ-voice of England,</div>
<div class="verse i4">Milton, a name to resound for ages,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,</div>
<div class="verse">Starr’d from Jehovah’s gorgeous armories,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean</div>
<div class="verse i4">Rings to the roar of an angel onset—</div>
<div class="verse">Me rather all that bowery loneliness,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And bloom profuse and cedar arches</div>
<div class="verse i4">Charm, as a wanderer out in ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Where some refulgent sunset of India</div>
<div class="verse">Streams o’er a rich ambrosial ocean isle,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And crimson-hued the stately palm woods</div>
<div class="verse i4">Whisper in odorous heights of even.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From one poet laureate of England to another is an easy
transition. Run we back to Wordsworth. Of Wordsworth’s
sonnet to Milton I need give only the last six lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">Pure as the naked heavens—majestic, free,</div>
<div class="verse">So didst thou travel on life’s common way</div>
<div class="verse">In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart</div>
<div class="verse">The lowliest duties on herself did lay.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Very different in spirit from anything hitherto given is that
burst of Shelley’s in his “Adonais,” allusive to Milton. It is
curious how Shelley, in his unchastised youth of eager beating
against the bars of convention and law, found his sympathy
with Milton as much in ideas political as in ideas poetical:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i18">He died</div>
<div class="verse">Who was the sire of an immortal strain,</div>
<div class="verse">Blind, old, and lonely, when his country’s pride—</div>
<div class="verse">The priest, the slave, and the liberticide.</div>
<div class="verse">Trampled and mocked with many a loathed rite</div>
<div class="verse">Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the gulf of death; but his clear sprite</div>
<div class="verse">Yet reigns o’er earth; the third among the sons of light.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the triumph of Milton as poet that he keeps his empire
undisputed over minds that kicked with utmost energy against
those religious sentiments which not only Milton the man held
dearest, but which Milton the poet insisted on making of the
very fabric of his verse. Byron, too, and this amidst the ribald
freedom of his “Don Juan”—<i>amidst</i> the freedom of it, and
<i>with</i> the freedom of it—says of Milton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A little heavy but no less divine.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will provide a conclusion conformed to a canon of ancient
art in letters which forbade climax at the close, if now we
present some lines from Byron, remarkable indeed, rather
for ingenuity of adaptation than for high poetry, but still illustrative
of the esteem compelled from their author for the sublime
genius of Milton. The lines to be cited belong to Byron’s
“Hints from Horace,” a work generally neglected, but certainly
of notable merit, if not comparatively so good as Byron
himself accounted it—who, I believe, preferred this satirical
paraphrase of Horace to his “Childe Harold.” For the full appreciation
of the passage following, one rather needs to have
before him for comparison the corresponding text of Horace.
Byron paraphrases and satirizes, the reins flung loose on the
neck of his foaming Pegasus. Bowles and Southey have just
been named for contempt, when, in contrast, the modesty and
majesty of Milton’s opening is referred to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Not so of yore awoke your mighty sire</div>
<div class="verse">The tempered warblings of his master lyre;</div>
<div class="verse">Soft as the gentle breathings of the lute</div>
<div class="verse">“Of man’s first disobedience and the fruit”</div>
<div class="verse">He speaks, but, as his subject swells along,</div>
<div class="verse">Earth, heaven and Hades echo with the song.</div>
<div class="verse">Still to the midst of things he hastens on,</div>
<div class="verse">As if we witnessed all already done;</div>
<div class="verse">Leaves on his path whatever seems too mean</div>
<div class="verse">To raise the subject, or adorn the scene;</div>
<div class="verse">Gives, as each page improves upon the sight</div>
<div class="verse">Not smoke from brightness, but from darkness light;</div>
<div class="verse">And truth and fiction with such art confounds,</div>
<div class="verse">We know not where to fix their several bounds.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There is more of poetry,” says Moore, “in these verses
upon Milton than in any other passage throughout the paraphrase.”
And more truth than poetry at that, one might justly
add.</p>

<p>The subject is not exhausted, but enough has been produced
to show that, in an eminent sense, Milton is a poets’ poet. I
bespeak for my favorite among all the bards of all time a joyous
and grateful observance of his annual day from every
loyal Chautauquan.</p>

<h3>THE TELESCOPE.</h3>

<p>Since much that we know about the heavenly
bodies, has been revealed to us through the medium of
the telescope, it may be advisable to give some slight account
of this instrument. As early as 1608 it appears to have been
invented in Holland by a professor of mathematics named
James Metius, though the honor is claimed by their friends for
several other parties, among them Lipperhey and Jansen,
spectacle makers in the town of Middleburg. The claims of
Jansen were supported by Peter Borelli, in a small volume
published in 1655, entitled “De Vero Telescopii Inventore,”
and he was for a long time regarded as the inventor. The
story runs that Jansen had shown a telescope sixteen inches
long to Prince Maurice and Archduke Albert, who realizing
the importance of such an invention in war, induced him to
keep it a secret. But the narrative given by Borelli rested on
such a slight foundation, that it obtained but little credence.
Later evidence shows that Hans Lipperhey, on the 2d of November,
1608, made application to the states-general of Holland
for a patent for “an instrument to see with at a distance,”
but was refused on the ground that the invention was already
known. While there is little doubt but that the discovery was,
as claimed, made in Holland, it is also highly probable that
great efforts were put forth for some time to keep the matter a
profound secret. At least, no results were published to the
world until made known by Galileo in the manner thus related
by Professor Newcomb: “About six months after the petitions
(for patents to the states-general of Holland) of Lipperhey and
Metius, Galileo was in Venice on a visit, and there received a
letter from Paris, in which the invention was mentioned. He
at once set himself to the re-invention of the instrument, and
was so successful that in a few days he exhibited to the astonished
authorities of the city a telescope magnifying three times.
Returning to his home in Florence, he made other and larger
ones which revealed to him spots on the sun, the phases of
Venus, the mountains of the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, the
seeming handles of Saturn, and some of the myriads of stars,
separately invisible to the naked eye, but whose combined
light forms the milky way. But the largest of these instruments
magnified only about thirty times, and was so imperfect
in construction as to be far from showing as much as can be
seen with a modern telescope of the same power.”</p>

<p>The telescope has been aptly compared to an eye. In the
eye nearly parallel rays of light fall on a lens, and this lens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
throws an image. In the telescope, nearly parallel rays of
light fall on a lens, and this lens throws an image, and then
another lens enables the eye to form an image of that image
by again rendering the rays parallel; these parallel rays entering
the eye just as rays do in ordinary vision. The efficiency
of the telescope depends on its power of illuminating and magnifying.
If the object glass (in a “refractor,” as an ordinary
spy-glass, the lens next the object viewed) be twenty times
greater than the pupil of the eye, it receives twenty times more
light, and forms an image theoretically twenty times as bright
(though practically much of the light is lost by reflection from
and passage through the object glass). The magnifying power
depends on the relative focal length (the distance from the
lens to the image) of the object glass and the eye-glass (the
lens next the eye). For example, if the focal length of the
object glass be twenty-five inches, and that of the eye-glass
one-half inch, then the magnifying power is represented by
the quotient of twenty-five by one-half, which is fifty. In order
to obtain a good image the illuminating power must be
good and the magnifying glass (eye-piece) perform its work
well.</p>

<p>Since the time of Galileo, refracting telescopes have been of
course much improved. Their size also has increased
until they are now constructed with object glasses twenty-six
inches in diameter; and it is reported that one is projected for
the Lick Observatory in California, which is to have an objective
thirty-six inches in diameter. Reflecting telescopes, so
called because instead of refracting or bending the rays of
light, they reflect them from a concave mirror, have been constructed
with circular mirrors six feet in diameter, and it is believed
by some makers that they can be successfully operated
when the mirrors are as much as seven or eight feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that in general the greater
the telescope, the more successful the observations. Both calculation
and experience indicate a limit beyond which increase
in size, even if it affords greater power, diminishes in clearness.
And it is of little value to us that we bring the moon apparently
within forty miles, if we can not distinguish its features—if
the face of the “man in the moon” should be a mere blur,
like a blot on a piece of paper. It is, in fact, exceedingly
doubtful whether the moon has ever been seen through the
telescope so well as it would be seen with the naked eye at a
distance of 500 miles.</p>

<p>To afford an idea of what has been done in the manufacture
of these instruments we mention the following: Of refractors,
the one in the United States Naval Observatory at Washington
has an object glass twenty-six inches in diameter; that of Mr.
R. S. Newall, Gateshead, England, an object glass of twenty-five
inches; Observatory of Harvard College, Cambridge,
Mass., fifteen inches; Allegheny Observatory, connected with
the Western University of Pennsylvania, at Allegheny, Pa.,
thirteen inches; Michigan University, at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
twelve and five-tenths inches; Middletown University, Connecticut,
eleven inches. Of reflectors, the one constructed by
the Earl of Rosse, at Parsontown, Ireland, has a mirror six feet
in diameter; the Observatory of Melbourne, Australia, four feet;
and Mr. S. Lassell, Marblehead, England, two feet in diameter.</p>

<h3>THE SUN</h3>

<p class="unindent">During this month makes us his shortest visit. This he does
on the 21st, making his stay about 9h. 16m. in length. Winter
begins theoretically the same day at 4:51 a. m., when the
sun stands still before he starts on his northern journey, and
the astronomers say that the sun enters <i>Libra</i>. On the 24th
at 2:00 p. m., sun is 90° east of Uranus, that is, is quartile with
this planet; on the 12th, at 2:00 a. m., he is 180° from Jupiter,
that is, in opposition; on the 31st, at 11:00 p. m., nearest the
earth; on the 1st, 16th and 30th he rises at 7:05, 7:18 and 7:24
a. m., and sets at 4:34, 4:35 and 4:44 p. m., respectively. Twilight
ends on the 16th at 6:17 p. m.</p>

<h3>THE MOON</h3>

<p class="unindent">Presents the ordinary phenomena of its changes as follows:
Full on the 2d, at 1:51 p. m.; last quarter on the 9th, at 6:22
a. m.; new on the 17th, at 8:16 a. m.; first quarter on the 25th,
at 8:13 a. m. It rises on the 15th, at 6:08 a. m., and sets on
the 1st and 30th, at 5:21 a. m. and 5:13 a. m. respectively. Is
nearest the earth on the 2d, at 9:30 p. m., and again on the
31st, at 10:48 a. m. Is farthest away from the earth on the
16th, at 11:06 p. m. Runs highest on the 4th, on which date
its altitude equals 68° 1′ 33″; and on the 31st, when its altitude
amounts to 68° 1′ 56″. It runs lowest on the 17th, when
the elevation is 30° 56′ 19″ in latitude 41° 30′ north.</p>

<h3>MERCURY</h3>

<p class="unindent">Presents us this month with an unusual number of phenomena,
none of which, however, are of a striking character. He rises
on the 1st at 8:28 a. m.; on the 16th, at 8:55 a. m.; on the 31st,
at 7:48 a. m.; sets on the corresponding days at 5:16, 5:53 and
5:20 p. m.; that is, during the entire month setting from one-half
hour to one and one-third hours later than the sun; and
thus being visible to a careful observer for perhaps ten or
twelve days both before and after the 17th, the day on which
he reaches his greatest distance (20° 12′) east of the sun. His
motion during the first seventeen days is 30° 33′ 44″ direct,
and for the remaining fourteen 5° 9′ 55.5″ retrograde. Diameter
increases from 5.2″ to 9.6″. At 3:00 p. m. on the 4th he
is 1° 26′ south of Mars; on the 19th, at 6:34 a. m., 6° 27′ south
of the moon; on the 25th, at 10:00 a. m., stationary; at midnight
on the 29th, 2° 25′ north of Mars; and on the 30th, at
5:00 a. m., reaches its nearest point to the sun.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Is now on the wane, decreasing from 14.2″ to 12.4″ in diameter,
though still an object of beauty in the morning sky. She
rises at 4:03 a. m. on the 1st; at 4:36 a. m. on the 16th, and at
5:10 a. m. on the 31st. Her motion is direct and equals 38° 30′
of arc. On the 14th, at 4:37 a. m., she is 1° 15′ south of the moon.</p>

<h3>MARS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Makes a very poor showing, his diameter being small, only
about 4.2″, and his rising and setting nearly the same as that
of the sun. At 8:35 a. m. he rises and at 5:33 p. m. sets on the
1st; on the 16th, rises at 8:25 a. m., and sets at 5:25 p. m.; and
on the 31st, rises at 8:11 a. m., and sets at 5:21 p. m., remaining
above the horizon on an average of about nine hours each
day. His motion is direct and amounts to 25° 57′ of arc. On
the 18th, at 1:35 p. m., he is 5° 59′ south of the moon. His declination
on the 1st is 24° 17′ south, and on the 31st, 22° 58′
south.</p>

<h3>JUPITER</h3>

<p class="unindent">Is morning star throughout the month, rising November 30th at

<h2 id="THE_LIBERAL_UPHEAVAL_IN_NORWAY">THE LIBERAL UPHEAVAL IN NORWAY.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BISHOP JOHN F. HURST.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In no European country has there been, in the last half century,
such a thorough coming up of liberal sentiment concerning
all that regards the rights of the citizen and the Christian
as in Norway. Lying at the northwest corner of the continent,
far removed from the excitements and jealousies common to
the nervous central countries, Norway has moved on in its
even way, and cared little for the general current of these
lands. But these Norwegians have not been asleep. Nor has
there ever been a time when they have slept, from the hazardous
day when their Vikings invaded Britain, and became forever
a part of the bone and fiber of Scotland in eastern England,
down to our century. All Norwegian history is a romance,
whether in former or recent times. The unexpected
change happens on those mountain sides and in those happy
valleys, and when a new movement does begin there it is apt
to overthrow the whole of Scandinavia. Norwegian impulses,
as a rule, have such abundant vitality in them that no
resistance can be made successfully against them. They are as
invincible with their new liberal policy, in state and church,
as was their Harold the Fair-Haired, who fought and slew
twenty-two hostile kings of Norway, in the one battle of
Stavenger, and made the land first and for the whole future
one and strong, and then took for his queen the fair lady who
had declared she would never marry him until he became king
of United Norway. He laid deep plans, and then both wise
and believing, waited ten long years, and so came the Norway
of to-day, stretching from North Cape down to Land’s Nose.</p>

<p>Here is an instance of the old and the anticipated never
taking place in Norway. When the country separated from Denmark
in the year 1814, and became consolidated with Sweden,
it produced its own constitution, and has ever since been independent
of either Scandinavian country, and produces all the
liberal political and ecclesiastical sentiment in northern Europe,
so far as the continent is concerned. But Norway has
the same king as Sweden, and the two constitute the kingdom
of Sweden and Norway. There is, however, nowhere a parallel
to their internal arrangements. While the countries are
one, there is a broad strip of felled forest, or open land, which
marks the boundary line between them. They have two different
postal systems, and two classes of postage stamps. The
crowning of the king in Stockholm does not make him king of
Norway. He must go five hundred and twenty-seven miles
northwest, and be crowned in the cathedral of the ancient capital
of Norway, Trondhjem, and be blest by Norwegian clerical
hands, and benedictions rung out by Norwegian bells, before
he is king of Norway. Then, too, he must have not only
a Swedish cabinet and court, resident in Stockholm, and his
two houses of Parliament as well, but must have the same
double headed arrangement in Christiania, the capital of Norway.
He must have his palace and court, his upper and lower
houses of Parliament, and his Ministry. Sweden can not make
a law for Norway, nor the latter for the former. The king has
two sets of men for everything, and unlike most kings, has duplicate
critics on every question of royal action.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Parliament, or Storthing, has always been a
troublesome thing to handle, by both kings and nobility. It is
made up of rich and poor alike—all men who prove themselves
worthy of the popular confidence. Until 1869 it met
only triennially, and as soon as it had fought a few months for
the people it could say no more for so long a time that there
was ample opportunity for its legislation to be half forgotten,
and, where there was a will, to be often evaded. But so rapidly
did the liberal sentiment grow throughout the land that
a law was at last made requiring the Storthing to meet annually.
This was the fatal day for the rule of the aristocratic
and bureaucratic spirit in Norway. When, in 1869, for the first
time, the parliament of the country found itself compelled to
come together every year, to revise the affairs of the country,
it began a series of legislative acts which covered all the great
and overlooked needs of the people, and, without treading
upon the authority of the throne, did pursue such a course as
the kings had been accustomed to think belonged only to
them. In 1872 the Storthing went so far as to order that the
king’s ministers, who hitherto had been shut out from all participation
in the proceedings of both houses, might appear,
and in case of need must appear, and give all needful information
concerning the points at any time under discussion.
They must be “interpellated” without let or hindrance, and in
this way be held responsible to the popular representations.
But the king would not sign this law. His ministers were antideluvian
and conservative, and strongly advised him not to
do it. The Storthing could do nothing. Here was a violent
clash between the people and the throne, and the relation was
strained more violently than at any other time in the last thirty
years. The fact is, the people had waked up, and were moving
on. The Storthing adjourned, and the members went home.</p>

<p>Now began a strong current of liberal sentiment, which
overspread the entire country. In five years, or by 1877, there
was such a liberal Storthing in session that the law requiring
the ministry to appear in person and give account of their discharge
of official duty, was again passed, with an overwhelming
majority. But the king and his ministry refused again to
favor it. The royal signature was withheld, and so the law
remained a dead letter. The same thing took place in 1879.
The same refusal knocked it to pieces. In 1882 matters began
to culminate. The Storthing passed the same law, by a vote
of one hundred and five to eight, and determined to see it
signed and executed. The king lost all patience. His ministers
advised him not only not to sign it, but to veto it. This
they supported, as his right, by a false interpretation of an article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the constitution. The Law Faculty of the University
of Christiania indorsed the veto as constitutional, and so for
the moment things seemed to be settled. Here was a case,
however, where the people stepped in, and formed themselves
masters of the king and his willing instruments. The next
Storthing boldly declared that the new law was valid, with or
without the king’s sanction, that he had no right to absolute
veto at all, and demanded the government to promulgate the
new law without ceremony, as a part of the laws of the land.
This the ministers refused to do. This procedure, with several
other unconstitutional acts, caused the Odelsthing, or select
body of the Storthing, to remove the ministers before the
Rigsret, which is the supreme court. From August 1883 until
January 1884 the court deliberated on the case, and at last pronounced
its verdict. We venture to say that no such excitement
has been seen in Norway since it dropped off from Danish
rule. By this verdict the entire ministry, including the
prime minister, Selmer, were declared to have forfeited their
right to be royal advisers, and two of the number were fined
eight thousand crowns, as penalty for disobeying the laws.</p>

<p>The king still hesitated. He claimed that he had the right
of veto, and was going to exercise it. The old and impeached
ministry went out, of course, but the new one was a question.
He chose, as his next ministry, the same kind of men he had
been having. They were known in the country as enemies of the
people’s rights, and the storm of indignation was violent
throughout the country. In this chaotic condition, Sweden
came in with its advice. The ministers over in Stockholm saw
that there was danger of losing Norway entirely, and they
plainly told the king that he must make peace there at all hazards.
The king now looked at the status of things with great
care, and seems to have feared for his crown. He turned suddenly
about, and chose a new ministry, with the renowned liberal
leader, Johan Sverdrup, as his premier. For thirty-three
years this man had been an advocate of the people’s rights, and
during all that time had been a member of the Storthing. He
was known in every valley and on every mountain in the land
of the midnight sun, as the one man who could be trusted to
defend the poor and fight for the largest liberty to every one.
He had been for at least a quarter of a century the most powerful
man of the country. He was feared and hated by every
despotic and aristocratic spirit in the land, and not one even
dared to attack his patriotism and honor. That King Oscar
should choose Sverdrup as his prime minister was infinitely
more of a revolution than when Queen Victoria took Gladstone
in place of Beaconsfield, to select a new ministry and preside
over it.</p>

<p>The changes consequent upon this new and happy resolution
of the king to make peace with the liberals, have been
complete, and of great numbers. The question of the king’s
veto of a law passed by the Storthing is settled forever. He
can not do it. The Storthing is king, in fact. No sooner were
the new ministry in power than they appeared in Parliament,
took part in all debates, answered all questions concerning the
policy of the government, and, to cap the climax, enlarged the
right of suffrage to such an extent that forty thousand citizens
could participate in all the canonical and political elections,
for the first time. As to the work done, the Storthing now did
more business in one week than had been done in months before.</p>

<p>This change in the political structure of Norway is the most
significant event in Scandinavian history since 1814. It not
only covers the past, but promises grandly for the future, to see
the coming of the people to the front, in the land of our old
Norse ancestors. And we may depend upon it that in Norway
there will be no going backward. The king has had a hard
task, but when the critical hour came, he chose discretion and
the interests of the people. This assertion by the people, that
they are supreme, means more than merely political liberation.
It means that the day is not far distant when the Norwegian
state church will be placed away among the rest of the useless
antiquities.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_HELP_THE_C_L_S_C">HOW TO HELP THE C. L. S. C.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY CHANCELLOR J. H. VINCENT, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The C. L. S. C. is an institution. It has an aim, a plan, an
organization, officers and members. It began, has grown, and
will continue to grow. The ends it proposes are useful and
much needed. They lay hold of personal character. They
reach society in the family, in the community, in the church.
They are ends intellectual, moral, domestic, social, and religious.
Every reason that can be urged in favor of general education,
of refined manners, of cultivated tastes, of religious principles,
of personal influence in favor of the true, the beautiful and
the good, may be presented in behalf of the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle. Its enthusiastic alumni, its undergraduates
and outside persons of sound judgment who have studied
its philosophy and watched its progress have said many strong
and beautiful things in commendation of it. And there is no
danger of saying too much, for however crude the beginnings
of the movement, one may easily see in it the most splendid
possibilities. The universal praise which the scheme has elicited
is all deserved. The C. L. S. C. is a great institution.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that institutions, however lofty in
purpose and practical in organization, can not grow or work
by virtue of mere aim and plan. Ideals and artistic apparatus
are essential, but without personal genius and labor are impotent
in the world of art. Something more is necessary to
a transatlantic passage than a dock at Liverpool and a seaworthy
steamer in New York. Between the two lie the conditions
of success in human enterprise and effort. The C. L. S. C.
needs appreciation as a scheme, but it needs also work—wise,
unremitting, indefatigable work, on the part of those who believe
in it.</p>

<p>The problem before us now is: How may we help the C. L.
S. C.? Every member who receives benefit from it, and who
believes in its value to others, may become an advocate and
representative and thus may induce numbers to test its worth.
This service, voluntary and uncompensated, is due to the Circle.
I propose to show how it may be most effectively rendered.</p>

<p>1. There are multitudes of people who would welcome the C.
L. S. C. as an angel of strength and comfort, if its existence
were but made known to them. They have no definite idea
about it. The mystic letters which represent it they have often
seen, but having “no interest in secret societies” have not
even asked what the C. L. S. C. is. They have seen the word
“Chautauqua,” and know that Chautauqua County is famous
“for butter and for Republican majorities.” Or they have heard
about a “camp meeting at Chautauqua,” which being a camp
meeting must of course be Methodist—and in “Methodist
camp meetings they have never taken much interest”—indeed,
they have a “prejudice against such things.” As for a “Sunday-school
Assembly” at Chautauqua, if they do not think of
it as “a big picnic with lots of children and barrels of peanuts,”
they class it among “the pious conventions which only
very good people care to attend.” Thus the widespread name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of Chautauqua means half a dozen different things, according
to the measure of the hearer’s ignorance. Now, members of
the C. L. S. C. can do a world of good to people who would
welcome and enter the Circle if they knew about it, by telling
of its aims to persons whom they casually meet, by distributing
the “Popular Educational Circular,” and by handing out judiciously
copies of “The Green Book.” Thus they could soon
disabuse minds which hold the superficial views of the movement
above indicated and convince them that Chautauqua is
not merely a “creamery,” that it is not a camp meeting, that
it is not Methodist, that it is not a children’s or Sunday-school
picnic at all, that Sunday-school work has a place, but a comparatively
small place in the great Chautauqua Idea and movement,
and that Chautauqua is CHAUTAUQUA—peculiar, instructive,
broad, far-reaching—a place and an idea, a school
and a society, a life and a power, representing all that is high
in human aims, all that is delightful in human fellowship, all
that is ennobling in broadest culture, all that is sanctifying in
intelligent and reverent worship. A few words would do all
this, for hosts of people who need and long for the very ministry
our noble cause fulfills. Speak the words, then, dear fellow
students, and distribute widely the circulars which spread this
information.</p>

<p>2. Having sown the seed watch the growth. Urge the friend
to whom you broach the subject to join the Circle. Take his or
her name and address; a postal card later on may be a reminder.
Insist upon prompt action in sending for blank form of
application. Elicit questions. Remove difficulties. Answer
objections. Be earnest and urgent, and from the seed by the
wayside may come up quite a harvest of good. You can not be
too urgent or emphatic. The cause and the institution justify
your zeal, and those whom you win to the experiment will soon
give it unequivocal indorsement, and will add a vote of thanks,
for your suggestion and importunacy. Personal interest in people
always pays. In a good work this interest yields the best
results. And this is a good work. The young man you follow
up with circulars and solicitations and offers of help will finally
yield through your very earnestness in his behalf. And the
more you help, the more zeal in the cause of the C. L. S. C.
you will develop in him. The discouraged woman to whom
the world of letters seems as inaccessible as the royal palace
at Windsor, will believe your testimony because of the faith
and fervor you show, and having had the door opened to her
will enter in, and at every step will give thanks for what she
finds, and for the thoughtful, sympathetic soul that pointed
her to Temple of Knowledge.</p>

<p>3. Use the local press in the interest of the Circle. The columns
of any paper in the land will be open to occasional items
concerning the Chautauqua movement and its courses of reading.
Editors who want news will be glad to receive your communications.
Editors who believe in popular education will
take a personal interest in the matter. They will cheerfully
write editorials on some phases of the subject. They will report
meetings of your local circle. They will publish choice
literary extracts in the line of the current required reading.
Suppose the subject for the month is Greek history and literature.
Find some gem from the critics, some exquisite translation
of a passage from Homer, Plato or Æschylus, some word-picture
from the historians or from modern travelers; copy
carefully, send to the editor, and ask its publication, and you
will be surprised to find how glad editors will be to enrich their
pages through your skill, taste and services. Every such item
of news or passage from literature, if connected with Chautauqua
or the C. L. S. C. will advertise the Circle and increase its
membership.</p>

<p>4. Use the public schools. Secure the coöperation of teachers,
especially high school principals and superintendents. Do
not try to induce pupils to join the Circle. They have enough to
do already, at school and at home. But watch the high school
graduates, and those young people dropping out of the various
grades, “giving up school,” as so many thousands do. Talk
to them about what the C. L. S. C. will do for them. Tell
them all about the “college outlook,” the “diploma,” the
“seals,” the “societies,” and “degrees.” Urge them to enter
this “Home College.” Press upon them the advantages.
And if the arguments you present be so strong as to determine
them not to give up school, but to keep on and enter college,
you can afford to excuse them from entering the C. L. S. C.
for this is the highest end of our Circle: To awaken an interest
in college education, and to induce young people to secure
it. Do not be disheartened if now and then a public school superintendent
or teacher looks disapprovingly or with a faint
touch of scorn on the C. L. S. C. It will be because he does not
understand it. No scholar of a high order, who knows what we
aim at and are doing, can disapprove the movement. He may
object to this book or that. About what book are there no differences
of opinion? He may find fault with the relative proportions
of literature and science in our course. All curriculums
are subjected to such criticisms. He may smile at our
desires for promoting the <i>esprit de corps</i>. College societies,
college athletics, college exhibitions have been often severely
denounced as puerile, dissipating, and all that. And one has
read college songs that have not been wholly weighted with
wisdom or composed in conformity with highest rhetorical
standards. No wise teacher can afford to sneer at the C. L. S.
C. The most eminent educators of the country are in sympathy
with it. Give your public school teachers a knowledge of
the system and they will coöperate with you in the promotion
of its interests.</p>

<p>5. Get the college men of your place enlisted. They are
bound to help it. The C. L. S. C. is among all the educational
movements of the age the best friend of the college system.
It is a John-the-Baptist, going in advance and preparing the
way in a wilderness-age of mercenary ambition, and among
masses of people apathetic concerning especially the higher
education. It goes into a household and captures parents
while the children are yet young or unborn. It gives intellectual
hope, confidence and ambition to those full grown men
and women who supposed having left school their education
had been finished. It gives them a new world to live in, a
world of good books, a world of high art, a world of refined
society. And into this world the children are born, and in this
world they are trained, and because of this larger, nobler world
they go to college. What put those better books and better pictures
into the home? The C. L. S. C. What inspired the literary
ambition in these mature people? The C. L. S. C. What filled the
house with college atmosphere and college longings? The C. L.
S. C. What led the mother to say and sing over and over again to
the smiling infant in her arms, “My darling is going to college
one of these days?” The C. L. S. C. If any people on the
continent should honor and further the C. L. S. C. it is the college
people, and as they learn its work they see its worth and
give it sympathy and help. Our most enthusiastic friends are
college presidents and professors.</p>

<p>Therefore make a point of enlisting college people in the
enterprise. They will be glad to join. It will do them good
after these years of neglect to read up Greek-in-English with
Dr. Wilkinson, or to have Professor Appleton and Dr. Edwards
tell them in their clear way what additions have been
made to the science of chemistry since it was studied in the
old college laboratory. There is not a subject or a book in
the C. L. S. C. course that it would not pay any college graduate
to read over again. And the really wise ones among them
will do it. We have thousands of college graduates on the
record lists of the Circle.</p>

<p>Where these men and women may not care to join for their
own sakes they may be induced to give <i>prestige</i> to the movement
for the sake of others. This is a power they have. They
may well be proud of it; and if by putting themselves side by
side with less favored people as fellow-students, they can help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
without seeming to do it, they may add to the influence and
profit of the Circle. Stir up and use the college people.</p>

<p>6. And now for the ministers! No class has greater influence
in matters pertaining to education. To hear some wiseacres
talk one would suppose that churches and ministers were
afraid of education. The fact is that both popular and higher
education owes more to the church than to any other organization
on earth, and college presidents and professors have for
the most part been clergymen or active laymen ready for Christian
service. The most efficient factor in the educational movements
of the world is Christianity.</p>

<p>The ministers are able to do more for the C. L. S. C. than
any other class. They have influence over the homes, and
especially over the youth of their congregations. If they do
not it is their own fault; and I have sometimes felt that the
Chautauqua plan was a providential appliance adapted to the
age, by which pastors may secure a firmer hold upon the young
people, and keep them in more perfect sympathy with the social
and spiritual ideas which it is the business of the church to
set forth. What intellectual dissipation and what moral weakening
follow the loose reading habits of the age! How can a
minister of Christ bring people to an appreciation of stability,
purity, thoughtfulness, by sermons on one day of the week
while all the other days are filled (what time is left from business)
with sensational and demoralizing stories, unreal in their
pictures of life and fearfully false in the ethical and theological
principles they embody? How can a minister train his people
to solidity and self-sacrifice and spirituality, whose highest
ideas of “society” are expressed in the sensuous and dangerous
pleasures in which a frivolous world delights, and which
by its consciousless requirements are made “fashionable?”
Priestly prohibition is worthless. Bitter denunciation is worse.
Appeals to higher tastes are useless—while the higher taste
is lacking. There is only one way out of the difficulty. It is
by “the expulsive power of a new affection.” To learn to
loathe the low, one must learn to love the high and holy. To
banish bad books we must create a delight in good books. To
make worldly society seem the sensuous and senseless thing it
often is, we must create a taste for refined, elevating and rational
society. To put dignity and stability into a life we must
feed it on truth, and cause it to delight in serving others. The
C. L. S. C. is the pastor’s helper in all these lines. It puts good
books into the hands of youth and age. It opens broad fields
for exploration. It discovers and develops personal aptitude.
It gives high ambitions. It makes conversation with rational
and cultivated people more agreeable than frivolous amusements
which have neither ideas nor useful inspiration in them.
It quickens conscience. It gives dignity to life. It makes usefulness
more desirable than self-gratification. It supplements
Sunday aspiration by week-day effort, and increases the power—intellectual,
social and spiritual—of every life and of every
home into which it comes. All this our ministers should feel.
If they knew they would feel. Then cause them to know. By
talk and by circulars stir them up.</p>

<p>When new tastes are developed among their young people,
tastes sanctified by prayer and fostered by lectures and lessons,
and books and conversation, the ministers seeing the
good work will appreciate the agency, and thank you for calling
their attention to the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>These are some of the radical ways of helping the C. L. S. C.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_ORGANIZE_A_LOCAL_CIRCLE">HOW TO ORGANIZE A LOCAL CIRCLE.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY REV. J. L. HURLBUT, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>1. The first step is for somebody to get thoroughly saturated
with the Chautauqua Idea, either at “the Mecca of us all,” or
some other Assembly, or by coming into contact with a live
Chautauquan. Find out what the C. L. S. C. is, what it aims
to do, and what it has already done in lifting up and inspiring
people. Chautauqua Hand-book No. 2 will tell you something
about its history and methods, and the C. L. S. C. number of
the <i>Assembly Herald</i> will shed more light in the address of Dr.
Vincent which it contains. But if you can get hold of the button
hole of an intelligent leader of a local circle, in half an
hour you can learn more of the working of the organization,
than in a half-day of reading about it.</p>

<p>2. The next step is to awaken the interest of others in the
subject. Talk about it in social conversation, especially with
the busy people, who feel their need of just what the C. L. S.
C. offers, an inspiration to and a helping hand in reading and
thought. Send to the general office for a number of copies of
the circular on “Popular Education,” and distribute them
where they will be appreciated and read. Let the Sunday-school
teacher talk to his Bible class, the Superintendent to
his school, the pastor to his congregation. Write an article for
the village paper about the good work of the circle among the
people. Secure the coöperation of the intelligent people in the
community, the doctor, the lawyer, the editor, the principal
and teachers of the public school, and let the town be awakened
on the subject of the People’s College. If these educated leaders
fail to take interest, do not be discouraged, but go on and
get up the circle among the few who will be aroused. We
know of a place where the first circle consisted of six members;
and now there are two hundred readers of the course in that
city.</p>

<p>3. Bring together those interested in the subject to hold a
meeting for the organization of a local circle. Do not limit the
constituency to any one social grade. It will do good to both
the banker and the plumber’s apprentice, the society lady and
the dressmaker, to meet on the common platform of an interest
in one subject of thought. If the circle be started under
the auspices of a church, make room for members from other
churches, for it does Christians good to look each other in the
face and study together. The best place for the meeting is the
big parlors of some warm-hearted householder who is in sympathy
with the enterprise, and the closer the crowd the better the
feeling is apt to be. Have on hand some Chautauqua Songs,
and learn a few of the best. Shake hands all around, and try
to make people acquainted.</p>

<p>4. At the meeting show a set of the books for the year’s reading,
and set forth the plan of the C. L. S. C. Then distribute
the copies of the application blanks, and proclaim a recess,
during which time the names of members will be received by
a Secretary <i>pro tem.</i> [Obtain the blanks in advance of the
meeting from the general office at Plainfield, N. J.] Two conditions
of membership, in my judgment, should be named.
First, that every member of the local circle should also be a
member of the general C. L. S. C. “Associate members” have
been the bane of many circles, for they are without responsibility;
follow the course only so far as they feel an inclination,
and are not true Chautauquans. You are uniting a company
of people for a definite purpose of study, and no others should
be admitted to membership. The second condition of membership
should be, that each one joining shall take part as
assigned in the meetings. If there is an implied distinction
between members speaking and silent, between workers and
listeners (who are apt to be critics), your circle will fail to accomplish
its highest mission, to develop the dormant abilities
of its members. The principles of the local circle should be
“every student a member, and every member a worker,” and
it will be far easier to establish these as conditions at the outset
than to work up to them afterward.</p>

<p>5. The second meeting should consist of members only, and
those who come for the purpose of becoming members. At
this meeting it may be desirable to prepare a simple set of rules,
though it is not necessary, and an elaborate constitution and
by-laws have crushed to death many societies. The better
way is to make rules as you need them, and to change them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
circumstances may require. Let the leader or organizer bring
to this meeting fifteen or twenty written or printed questions
on the readings for the coming week or fortnight, and distribute
them among the members, in alphabetical order of names, to
be answered at the next meeting. A better plan, if practicable,
is to print the program for the next meeting, with names of
participants, by means of some duplicating process like the
papyrograph or hektograph, and give a copy to each member.
Assign your fifteen topics among the first fifteen names, so that
all will be on an equality, but assign them with some regard to
fitness, so that the most difficult question will not fall to the
most untrained student.</p>

<p>6. The only officers needed are a president, vice-president,
secretary and treasurer; and as everybody knows what their
duties are it is not necessary to define them in a written constitution.
Two committees may be chosen, each of which
might consist of a single person. [Spurgeon says that the best
committee consists of three, of whom one is sick and another
out of town.] One committee to prepare the program of the
meetings, another to provide music, either vocal or instrumental,
to vary the exercises.</p>

<p>7. The mention of a treasurer suggests that there may be
small expenses to the circle, for secretary’s book, postage,
printing, etc. This may be obtained through voluntary contribution,
through assessment, or through fines on absent members.
In some circles it is obtained by making some person,
generally the local bookseller, the agent to procure the books
and receive subscriptions for the <span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span>. The members
pay the agent the full price, of which he gives a certain
percentage to the treasurer, thus supplying a fund upon which
drafts may be made for necessary expenses.</p>

<p>These are our hints concerning organization. The local circle
is now launched, and we give it the Chautauqua salute,
wishing it a successful voyage.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LOCAL_CIRCLE">THE LOCAL CIRCLE.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY LEWIS C. PEAKE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>You say “There is no circle in my neighborhood.” It may
be so, but if you want one you may have it. If you desire to
form one in a church (and if every church had a circle connected
with it, its power would be immeasurably increased),
get, if possible, the coöperation of the pastor. If you fail to secure
his active assistance, as you very likely may, he will be
pretty sure to give you his moral support and good will, without
which little can be done in connection with any church.
If, however, he can see his way clear to active participation,
so much the better for the circle, as well as for himself. He
has made another bond between pastor and people. If the
proposed circle be in connection with a Y. M. C. A., get hold
of the general secretary in the same manner and for the same
reason. Wherever it may be, get, if you can, by private effort,
one or two persons (as many more as possible) interested in
the movement. Then, as near the first of October as possible,
call a meeting of all interested in mental and moral culture,
old as well as young, explain the object and aim of the C. L.
S. C.; have blank forms of application for membership, and
get as many as possible committed to it there and then. As a
rule there need never be a failure. A large membership is not
essential to success; indeed, much of the most satisfactory
work is done in small circles of from four to a dozen members.
Many a family circle has been blessed by being formed into a
C. L. and S. circle.</p>

<p>A good deal of the success of a circle depends upon the person
chosen as leader, conductor, president, or whatever name
may be given to the chief executive officer; hence the importance
of the question, who should occupy this position? The
president should be the best person in the circle, be he man
or woman; one of admitted preëminence among the members;
one who is sufficiently interested to undertake and persevere
in the study for its own sake, either to benefit himself
or to enable him to help others, and not simply to patronize the
Circle. The C. L. S. C. neither asks nor accepts patronage
from any. The president should be a man of good general information
and common sense. One who knows how to express
himself in good plain Saxon, and when to stop. One who is
regular and punctual in his attendance. A good conversationalist.
One who will diligently pursue the course of reading, so
that he may be in a position to <i>lead</i> the circle. If, in addition
to these qualifications, he be a college trained man or a
teacher, his power will be greatly enhanced. Get, if you can,
one who through attendance at Chautauqua, has become thoroughly
imbued with the spirit of the movement. Failing in
this, do your best to induce him to go there next season.</p>

<p>Next to the office of president, that of secretary is the most
important in the circle. So much of the working of the circle
depends upon this officer, that it is not easy to attach too
much importance to the selection of a suitable person for the
position. The president and secretary usually constitute the
cabinet of the circle, hence the need of a perfect understanding
between them. To this end frequent and easy communication
is desirable. The secretary should be one capable, not
only of keeping a fair and accurate record of the membership
and business of the circle, but of suggesting methods for increasing
the membership, adding to the comfort and convenience
of those attending the circle meetings, etc.; a wide
awake person with a great deal of thought for others.</p>

<p>In conducting your local circle, do not seek to use any stereotyped
plan. That which has proved the best for some circles
may not be so well adapted to yours. Study your surrounding
circumstances, the habits and employments of the members,
etc. One of the most satisfactory meetings I have known was
held during the study of Roman History. The general subject
was divided into two parts—B. C. and A. D. Each of these
was again divided into Internal and External history, the
former treating of the intellectual growth, laws, literature, etc.,
and the latter, of the wars, conquests and extension of the empire.
The subjects were apportioned to four members who
each occupied ten minutes, and a general discussion ensued.
Where the circle is located in the vicinity of an educational institution,
advantage may frequently be taken of the learning
and teaching ability of some of the professors, many of whom
would gladly render assistance in the matter, by delivering a
lecture or teaching a lesson upon certain subjects under consideration.
To this willingness on the part of eminent specialists
to communicate freely from their store of knowledge, I
gladly bear testimony. Get the members to prepare brief papers
or criticisms upon certain phases of the subjects under
consideration. These might be anonymous, if by that means
some timid ones might be drawn out. Begin and close promptly
on time. Sing the Chautauqua songs and persevere until all
can and do sing them.</p>

<p>A good deal of interest might be awakened in the C. L. S.
C. by steady effort. Furnish the local press with interesting
items, accounts of circle meetings, an occasional paper prepared
and read before the circle, etc. Editors are not dull;
they will soon come to see that so far from patronizing you,
they are really your debtors, and will give all the aid you reasonably
ask of them. An occasional article in the religious
weeklies will do good service, and such articles, brief and well
written, will almost always command insertion. By all means
cultivate the press. Circulate the Popular Education circulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which, with forms of application, can be obtained in any quantities
necessary from the head office. Send and give them to
your friends. Talk about the circle. Be interested in it, and
show that you are. Invite your friends occasionally to the
circle meetings. The observance of the Memorial Days affords
fine opportunities for introducing the work of the circle
to persons who have not given much attention to it. Best of all
is to induce your friends to spend a week or two at Chautauqua
in August, where the animus of the movement may be seen
and studied as it can be nowhere else. This plan seldom fails.</p>

<p>The local circle keeps warm and vigorous through the year
the spirit of the summer assemblies. Indeed, to the local circles
we believe we are indebted for much of the enthusiasm of
the summer meetings. Their students garner rich harvests of
thought and feeling in the long months of study, and the assemblies
are but the meeting places to compare work, rest
weary brains, gather fresh zeal and plan new undertakings.
They are becoming necessary elements in the work. Students
are feeling we must have an assembly. If we can not go to
Chautauqua, we must have a local meeting. This feeling is
leading to a great multiplication of centers. One of the latest
plans we have learned of from the Toronto <i>Globe</i>, which says
in a recent issue: “For some months past a few gentlemen
have been quietly working to secure the control of the beautiful
Oak Grove on the banks of the Niagara River, above the
town, and near the famous old Fort George, as an assembly
ground to be affiliated with the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle, and also for general Sunday-school and temperance
work. A deputation waited on Chancellor Vincent recently,
and secured his hearty consent to coöperate, as far as
possible, and aid the work in the direction indicated.”</p>

<p>A new and delightful summer center for our work is promised
by the active interest which the members of the local circle
of <span class="smcap">Ocean Grove, N. J.</span>, are taking in extending their
bounds. The circle is fortunate in having among its members
Rev. J. L. Corning, director of the Department of History and
Literature of Art in the Chautauqua University. Mr. Corning
recently favored the circle with a most interesting article on the
“Geography of Greece,” showing how the peculiar configuration
of the country had helped in forming its military and political
supremacy, and had aided in developing the national individuality.
The outlook of the circle Mr. Corning gives in a
recent letter to the <i>Ocean Grove Record</i>, in which he says:
“The Ocean Grove local circle of the C. L. S. C. in its new
organization is yet in its infancy, being only a few weeks
old. But it has already proved its calling to a noble mission
as auxiliary to every appliance of religious and moral influence
which in some sense is peculiar to this place. A most
fortunate circumstance for its prosperity is found in the active
sympathy of the resident officers of the Camp-meeting Association.
Those honored men already divine the good work
which the new agency contemplates, and have enlisted in it
their cordial coöperation. Especially favored is our youthful
organization in having my most valued friend, Dr. Stokes, for
its presiding officer. He will bring to this auxiliary mission
the same high qualities of mind and heart which have marked
his successful administration as a guiding spirit in the noble
religious works of the association. The duty and privilege of
securing personal membership in the Ocean Grove local circle
of the C. L. S. C. can not be too strongly commended to the
winter residents both of this and our neighboring town. To
the young, especially, who need intelligent guidance, systematic
habits and periodical inspiration in intellectual culture,
this local organization will bring inestimable benefit. The
Ocean Grove local circle of the C. L. S. C. is an organization
with large possibilities before it. Its constituency need not
necessarily be limited to the permanent residents of this highly
favored locality, but may include as well, an unlimited auxiliary
force from the thousands who gather on this hallowed spot
during the summer. Upon the growth and work of this subsidiary
organization will, in a great degree, depend the recognition
which the great mother organization will have in the annual
summer gatherings which have given Ocean Grove an
enviable name all over our land.”</p>

<p>In connection with these projected assemblies we have the
pleasure of giving our readers an account of a local assembly
which held its first session last summer. When we reported in
October the local summer assembly at Lake Grove, Auburn,
Me., we were not aware that another similar assembly had been
held within the boundaries of the same state. It is but recently
that we have received the program of the Maine Chautauqua
Assembly, the first session of which was held from July 23d to
August 2d, at <span class="smcap">Martha’s Grove, Fryeburg, Me.</span> The idea of
a Maine Assembly originated with Mrs. Martha Nutter, a noble
hearted woman of Cape Elizabeth, who wished to see the
spread of the Chautauqua plan of study in Maine, and to have
a permanent organization of the C. L. S. C. meeting once a
year for a few days, something after the plan of the larger assemblies.
At first it seemed that the movement would not be
successful, but through the earnest efforts of Mrs. Nutter, assisted
by Rev. John Collins, also of Cape Elizabeth, and Mrs.
Stickney, of Brownfield, promises of lectures, readings, essays
and music were obtained, programs were printed and sent out
among the people. When the time appointed for the meeting
arrived, July 28th, there was a goodly number of enthusiastic
Chautauquans gathered at Martha’s Grove. The entire program
was successfully carried out, and the meetings lasted
throughout the week. During the meetings a regular organization
was formed under the name of “The Maine Chautauqua
Union,” officers were elected and a vote was passed to meet
at the same time and place another year. No lovelier
spot could be selected for such a gathering than Martha’s
Grove. There is a large growth of elm trees, which furnish a
delightful shade, while beneath is a carpet of green, where
a speaker’s stand and seats are erected, and here are held
nearly all the meetings. This grove borders on the Saco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
River, and just across its banks is obtained a lovely view of
Mount Kearsarge, while other peaks of the White Mountain
Range are seen in the distance. A pleasant drive of two
miles, past flourishing farms and through the lovely village
of Fryeburg, and the station on the P. &amp; O. R. R. is
reached.</p>

<p>Quite as unique and delightful, though less ambitious, was a
gathering which assembled weekly during the past summer at
the <span class="smcap">Profile House</span>, far up among the <span class="smcap">Franconia Mountains</span>
of <span class="smcap">New Hampshire</span>. It was formed early in August, by six of
the waitresses of the hotel. They held their meetings sometimes
in the quiet forests, sometimes in their rooms, and spent
the two lovely months of August and September reviewing the
readings of the year. It must have been a beautiful, inspiring
hour, to the members of the little circle, when they would lay aside
their duties, and under the trees of those lovely mountains
turn their thoughts to their books.</p>

<p>Even Chautauqua itself keeps the germ of its power aglow
through all the fall, winter and spring, by a local circle. From
this center of centers a friend writes us of the life and work
that has taken the place of the summer’s study and enthusiasm.
The pleasant letter gives a picture which our friends will enjoy,
we believe, as well as we did. “You have seen a New
England cellar banked up for winter? Then imagine the Amphitheater
securely shut in by a five-foot tight board fence all
round about. Something very precious must be stored there!
Mayhap the seeds that shall next summer blossom into eloquence.
Imagine all the Athenian watch-fire pillars, huddled
into a corner of the Hall of Philosophy, like a shame-faced
group of oriental women. Think of the Point, the docks, as
absolutely silent; the lake without a sail, or even a row boat,
save that of some solitary fisherman, drifting. Think of gathering
nuts by the quart among the rustling leaves of the old
Auditorium; of seeing the cottages stripped of their hand-painted
decorations, ‘Boarding and Rooms.’ Two daily excitements
still remain: the meatman’s bell each morning rings,
and the stage brings the one bag of mail at noon. The crowds
seemed loth to leave this year, but the lingerers left in a body,
and silence seemed suddenly to fall upon the place. There is
settled down for the winter a genial, social company of live
people, and it is evident that soon there will not be evenings
enough in the week in which to accomplish all the delightful
things the weeks will bring to enjoy. Indeed, this seems to me
in several senses, a remarkable, a model, community. All
social life centers in the little chapel. Here an enthusiastic
C. L. S. C. meets each Tuesday evening, and each Sabbath at
the vesper hour, the bell, whose echoes reach so far, calls an
earnest company to the dear old hall.”</p>

<p>Turning to our eastern circles, the first report of the month
comes from the “Ashuelot” local circle of <span class="smcap">Swanzey, N. H.</span>,
which is still prospering, and has begun on its second year of
work. “It is composed of thirteen regular members of the class
of 1887, with eleven local members. Nearly all are diligent
students and active workers. The Rev. Benjamin Merrill, one
of the presidents of the New England class of ’87, is an enthusiastic
Chautauquan and member of our local circle. Our
meetings are opened with prayer, and often closed with a
Chautauqua song. At the opening each member repeats a
quotation, and waits for the class to name the author if they
are able to do so. At each meeting a portion of the required
reading is assigned to each member of the class, as a special
lesson for the next succeeding meeting. Both the regular and
the local members are expected to prepare condensed reviews
of the topics thus allotted to them, which are usually recited
from memory. In order to give time for questions and remarks,
each of these reports is limited to five minutes. The subjects
considered often call out animated discussions, which are conducted
in a friendly, conversational manner. A critic is appointed
by the president at each meeting, to notice errors in
language, and report at the close. The meetings increase
in interest, are instructive and entertaining, and the work done
is thorough. We have been favored with some excellent essays
and poems by members of the circle.”</p>

<p>October 1st is the anniversary day of the C. L. S. C. of
<span class="smcap">Franklin, Mass.</span>, and this year their second anniversary was
observed in a manner highly creditable to the circle, as it was
also enjoyable to their friends. The exercises were listened to
by an audience of nearly six hundred people, fully one hundred
and fifty of them being Chautauqua students. By a generous
outlay of money the circle secured the services of talented
musicians from Boston and vicinity. They were also
fortunate in securing the Rev. J. L. Withrow, D.D., the eloquent
preacher of Park Street Church, Boston, to deliver their Commencement
address. The topic selected by this eminent
speaker was “The Intellectual Signs of the Times.” It was a
vigorous, instructive, and exceedingly entertaining address.
The Franklin Circle has secured its publication in full, in the
local paper of that town. A very interesting original poem,
prepared for the occasion, was read by the author, the Rev. Wm.
M. Thayer, of Franklin, the topic being “What is Thought?”
The chapel was very beautifully decorated with the national
colors, with deep-hued autumn leaves, and bouquets of choice
flowers, arranged about the platform. The occasion was full
of inspiration to the members and their friends, and opened
in a very interesting manner the new year of the C. L. S. C.
course. About twenty-five new members have enrolled themselves
upon the books of this circle, as members of the class of
’88.</p>

<p>After the Assembly at South Framingham, an evening was
spent in the church at <span class="smcap">West Chelmsford, Mass.</span>, on the
Chautauqua Idea, the result of which was a local circle consisting
of twelve members, nine of whom are regular members
of C. L. S. C., of the class of ’88. All are enthusiastic over
the studies. The circle meets twice a month, following somewhat
the order of exercises suggested in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<p>We learn from the <i>Palladium</i>, of <span class="smcap">New Haven, Conn.</span>, that
the first fall meeting of the “Woolsey” circle, composed of members
of the “Pansy Class,” was held on the evening of October
15th. The members witnessed some very interesting experiments
in chemistry by James D. Whitmore, of the high
school. Mr. Whitmore expressed his hearty sympathy in the
C. L. S. C. organization, and any similar movements calculated
to elevate young or old in searching for knowledge. In a
very pleasing way he made all who were present feel perfectly
unrestrained, frequently requesting them to gather close around
him and the table, that they might the more perfectly witness
the results of his experiment. The “Woolsey” circle has now
entered upon the second year of its course of reading, and has
increased its membership from twenty-eight to forty-two.</p>

<p>A second local circle was organized in <span class="smcap">Pawtucket, R. I.</span>, on
September 29th. It has taken the name of the “Pleasant
View Local Circle,” and counts sixteen regular members, beside
several “locals.” A report of methods, plans, and special
work, we trust, will soon come from these new friends.
They may be sure that they have a hearty welcome from all
members of the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>This fall, after three years of hard work in the C. L. S. C.,
the little circle of ladies at <span class="smcap">Oneida, N. Y.</span>, entered upon their
senior year. During the past term of their reading they have
held weekly meetings at the homes of the members, rarely in
all this time missing an evening. These gatherings have been
informal and home-like, but withal very thorough. Their plan
has been to read aloud, criticising carefully every point in the
reading—an excellent plan, and one which does much to
make good the sentiment which they write us that they heartily
believe in: “Trifles make perfection, but perfection is no trifle.”
Lively discussions often arise over some point of their reading,
and do much toward strengthening their interest. They
report that during their course they have observed nearly all
of the Memorial days—an excellent plan, and one which always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
compensates in the ideas and inspiration which it gives,
for the extra work it may cause.</p>

<p>There is a circle at <span class="smcap">Wellsville, N. Y.</span>, that has the rare
honor of having been in successful operation since 1878. They
have graduated members in the classes of ’82 and ’83, and now
number nineteen members, representing each of the four
classes. A friend writes of their last annual reunion: “The
last of August we held our annual reunion, which has been usually
held at the home of some member, but this year, as last,
was made a surprise; we succeeded so perfectly in this as to
have our coming only made known by our hearty singing of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Hail the day with joy and singing,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Swell the chorus, full and ringing,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Love to Alma Mater bringing—</div>
<div class="verse i4">All hail! C. L. S. C.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Our repast was bountiful, and the decorations were worthy
the loving hands that arranged them. We sat long at the table,
and gave the time more to song and toast than to food.
These reunions are so enjoyable that I think their fame is causing
many in our town to feel that it would be very pleasant to
be numbered with us. One of the ’82 graduates is pursuing
his third year at Wesleyan University, and his presence at
these reunions adds to our pleasure.”</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Johnstown, N. Y.</span>, the secretary writes us that on October
1st the circle was reorganized, and the officers for the
year elected.</p>

<p>For two years the “Clinton” circle of <span class="smcap">Newark, N. J.</span>, has
been quietly but seriously working. On the 14th of October
it began its third year’s work. Of the plans which have governed
them each year we have a brief outline: “We endeavor
to amuse and profit ourselves by embracing as great a variety
of general lines in our programs as possible; for example: Our
first president, a C. L. S. C. graduate, made our meetings especially
attractive by illustrating the lessons in geology with
maps, engravings, fossils, ores, etc., and bringing ‘the heavens
near by’ with blackboard and crayon. Our second year
president fostered and developed the question-box idea, and
encouraged the preparation of original papers. This year we
hope to make famous with special exercises <i>in memoriam</i>, lectures,
glees, quotations, and question matches.” At the meeting
of the circle on October 30th, among other happily chosen
exercises was a talk on “Europe” by a cultured traveler from
their circle, who has lately returned from a trip abroad.</p>

<p>The chemistry in this year’s course is going to prove a most
delightful part of the year’s reading, affording, as it does, such
ample opportunity for interesting experiments. One of the first
circles to report their work in this line is the “Parker Circle”
of <span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, of which the <i>Evening Critic</i> of that
city says: “‘Parker Circle,’ C. L. S. C., has taken up the work
of the year with increased vigor, the meetings being well attended
and very interesting. A special meeting was held last
evening at the residence of the president, A. P. Steward, to
give opportunity to the members to witness some experiments
in chemistry, a portion of the required reading of this year’s
course being upon this interesting subject. The experiments
were conducted by Mr. W. T. Criswell, chemist. Hydrogen
and oxygen gases were successfully generated, hydrogen soap
bubbles blown and then exploded by igniting them, recently
extinguished tapers relighted by oxygen, sodium and potassium
burned on water, arsenic and antimony tests made, etc.,
etc. Only one slight explosion occurred, which caused much
amusement, but no harm resulted except to the test tube, which
was blown to atoms.” The plan of the “Parker” circle in securing
a practical chemist to conduct their experiments is wise.
There is always more or less danger in operating with gases,
and we earnestly recommend circles who wish to see these
beautiful experiments to engage the services of some one
skilled in laboratory work.</p>

<p>A neighbor to the “Parker” circle is the “Pansy” circle of
our national capital. We have received from this circle a
poem lately written in its honor, from which we extract the following
verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>It is a great pleasure to hear from circles who have been
steady workers for some time, but have never sent us reports.
Such a bit of circle-history comes to us from <span class="smcap">Rootstown, Ohio</span>.
A friend writes: “We organized a circle October, 1882, with a
membership of twenty, and surely a good report is due the
circle for the two years’ work they have done. The benefit
received has been many fold, the discipline obtained by having
a certain course of reading to pursue has already been perceptibly
felt. A taste for the better class of reading has been
cultivated, and a feeling of sociability gained among the
young people, brought about by common interests. As we are
ready to start in with our third year’s reading, all our former
members will not respond at roll-call. During last year, we,
as a class, were very much bereaved by the loss of our former
president, Mrs. H. O. Reed, who was untiring in her efforts to
organize the circle here, and who happily presided over our
meeting for the first year, always entertaining the class at her
own home. She was the first of our number to pass through
the ‘Golden Gate’ at Chautauqua, graduating August 1883.
The following December, on Christmas day, her spirit passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
through the ‘Golden Gate’ to join the great ‘Circle’ of the
redeemed above. We have been so fortunate as to have three
clergymen belonging to our order, one, who graduated with
the class of ’84. Our regular meetings have been opened with
singing, prayer, and scripture reading. The specified memorial
meetings have generally been observed. The programs
have been arranged by a committee, and have consisted of roll-call,
responded to by quotations from authors specified, followed
by articles prepared on topics connected with the subjects
we were reading, after which a poem was generally read.
The last hour we have devoted to miscellaneous topics and the
questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. During the latter part of ’83
we had a Round-Table which we found very interesting.”</p>

<p>How many stories of wit and wisdom find their center at
Chautauqua. One of the most entertaining we have seen
comes from a member of the <span class="smcap">Detroit, Mich.</span>, local circle, Mr.
G. F. Beasley, a lawyer of that city, and bears the title of
“John Scroggin’s First Visit at Chautauqua.” It is a bright
and real description of the first visit of a farmer and his sturdy
boys and girls to Chautauqua, of their funny mistakes, their
gradual appreciation of the “Idea,” and finally their complete
metamorphosis into typical Chautauquans; for at last</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">Farmer Scroggins was delighted</div>
<div class="verse i2">When he saw, in one united,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Sport and culture for the millions such as he,</div>
<div class="verse i2">When he saw his children prying</div>
<div class="verse i2">Into things he rarely scanned;</div>
<div class="verse i2">When his house became a college</div>
<div class="verse i2">Where his children gathered knowledge,</div>
<div class="verse">And that books and apparatus were in very great demand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">Books were mingled with their pleasures,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Curious eyes were open wide;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Problems found a quick solution,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Telling words found elocution,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And they coaxed and coaxed and toasted him beside.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We should like to give all of the story, had we space, yet
does not nearly every member of the C. L. S. C. know a John
Scroggin who, under the influence of our magic <i>alma mater</i>,
has seen “his house become a college?” It is, we believe, a
familiar story not only in Detroit, but in Maine, California,
and Texas.</p>

<p>There are two important circles in <span class="smcap">Detroit</span>. The “Pansy
Circle,” of which Mr. J. W. Green, a graduate of ’83, is president,
numbers twenty-seven members. They hold their meetings
at the home of the president, meeting weekly on Monday
evening. The president and his wife are very enthusiastic
over the C. L. S. C., and are well adapted to fill the important
offices to which their club has elected them. From the president
of the “Central” C. L. S. C., of the same city, we have received
a most entertaining record of the past year’s work.
“The circle began the year of ’83 and ’84 with a membership of
forty-eight. The first regular meeting was held at the Conservatory
of Music, September 19, when the officers were
elected. We now have enrolled the names of seventy paying
members, twenty-six of whom are members of the general Circle.
The circle has held forty-one regular meetings, two of
which were spent in listening to very interesting lectures by
Professor Winder. The evening of January 24 was spent debating
the “Free Trade” question. February 21 Rev. Dr.
Reilly lectured for the circle on “Christian Evidences Historically
Considered.” May 29 the circle debated the “Indian
Question.” During the year we have given four entertainments,
and one reception. The latter was given in honor of
Dr. Vincent, on September 24, at the residence of our president.
The William Cullen Bryant Memorial Day was celebrated
November 2, 1883. It was a very enjoyable entertainment,
consisting of readings from Bryant, with music interspersed,
followed by an elegant collation. The second Milton
evening was spent very pleasantly at the home of our vice
president. The C. L. S. C. met to celebrate Longfellow’s
birthday. The program comprised readings, several tableaux
and music, after which refreshments were served. The Shakspere
entertainment, given at the Conservatory of Music, was
one of the most pleasant of the series, many members were
present, the selections were finely rendered, and the music was
unusually good. The commencement exercises were held at
Conservatory of Music, July 2. I will let the reports which
were in the papers give you the description: ‘The Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle closed their season last
Wednesday evening at the Conservatory of Music. The attendance
was large and the program one of unusual excellence.
The “Class History,” by Mrs. Gillett, was a pleasant
record of the doings of the society the past year, and was
bright and well written. An address by T. D. Hawley, covering
the existence of the circle, and a beautiful tribute to the
late Mrs. Clark, the first president, was one of the noticeable
features of the evening. A prophecy by Miss Todd was highly
amusing and full of local hits. The music was especially good,
both vocal and instrumental. A fantasie on the zither and
violin by Mrs. Boyle and W. J. Kohlaas was rapturously received.’”</p>

<p>There is a great deal due to the president of a circle. An
energetic president will make a live circle. We do not wonder
that at <span class="smcap">Pendleton, Ind.</span>, the membership has increased
twenty-five per cent., and that there was never such a manifestation
of zeal and determination. Their president, Dr. A.
S. Huston, puts life and skill into whatever he does. We hope
to receive an extended report from Pendleton in the year.</p>

<p>No more systematic plan of work has come to our notice
this year than that which we have received from the Alpha
circle of <span class="smcap">Quincy, Ill.</span> This circle began its fall’s work by
celebrating Garfield’s day; again on opening day, October 1,
they met, elected officers and received new members. The
circle, when reorganized, numbered about twenty-four members.
They seem to have all the necessary elements for success—a
large and live membership and an energetic president,
of whom they write: “He is nothing less than a living
library.” Their meetings are held each week. The weekly
printed program cards contain the mottoes, the outline of study
for each week, and the exercises which are arranged for each
evening. We notice that they made the experiments in chemistry,
and they write us that they had splendid success with
them. The exercises are enlivened by music, and the Chautauqua
songs stand prominent. The plan recommended in
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for October—a pronouncing match on
Greek names—was one of the features of a joint meeting of
the Alpha and Beta circles on the last week of October; they
write that it was hugely enjoyed. In order to help the participants
in this “match” the back of the programs contained a
key compiled for the Quincy circles, on how to pronounce
classic names, giving rules for accent, syllabication, and
sounds of the letters.</p>

<p>A friend who caught her inspiration for the C. L. S. C. work
at Chautauqua itself, and who has induced several members
to join the ranks, writes us of a new circle of eighteen members
at <span class="smcap">Tonica, Ill.</span> An excellent feature of this circle is
that though three of its members are to graduate in ’86, while
the remainder are all new members, yet there is a delightful
spirit of unity in the work. All doing the same reading irrespective
of class distinctions, makes the local circle possible,
and promotes a fund of good feeling and coöperative study,
otherwise impossible. The circle at Tonica has only just
started, and, of course, as yet has no plan of work to report.
No doubt, as is generally the case with our Illinois friends, they
will soon send us accounts of happy plans and successful
work.</p>

<p>The reports which <span class="smcap">Marshalltown, Iowa</span>, send are frequent
and always encouraging. The president writes: “Our
circle would like to let the rest of the Chautauqua world know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that we are still engaged in the good work. The ‘Alden’ circle,
which met last year as two divisions of the same circle, this
year adds twenty or more names to the class of ’88, and has
organized as two separate circles. The evening circle retains
the name of Alden. The new circle (formerly the afternoon
division) has adopted the name of ‘Vincent,’ and has twenty-eight
names recorded. The old members are glad vacation
is over and the new ones take up the work with enthusiasm.
October 14 the two circles celebrated the beginning of a new
Chautauqua year by a grand banquet, which passed off very
pleasantly.”</p>

<p>It is of great value to the C. L. S. C. to have the support of
the local press. In no other way can so much and so effective
work be done. A circle which lacks the will to extend its
boundaries, and which selfishly is content with “our set,” can
not reap the full benefit of our work. We need to take in
others, to be always open to receive members, and to employ
the best means to make ourselves and our hospitality known.
The local paper is the best medium for this. Many of our
friends have proven this so, among them the Chautauquans of
<span class="smcap">De Soto, Mo.</span>, who send newspaper announcements of two
meetings recently held, giving their program and entertainments,
and cordially inviting others to join them. The effect
can not but be good. The program which they offer recommends
itself to every reader as meaning serious study and
genuine culture, and the hearty summons to come and join
them proves a catholicity of spirit even more desirable than
culture.</p>

<p>In the neighboring state of <span class="smcap">Kansas</span>, at <span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, the
circle has followed a similar plan. They publish in their local
papers a review of the extent of the C. L. S. C. work, describe
its methods, and then call attention to their own goodly company
of forty members, who are all anxious to receive cordially
any one who may desire to undertake the reading. The
Williamsburg circle holds monthly public meetings and does
the work of the month through the medium of sub-circles,
which meet more frequently—a plan which in several large
circles we have known to work admirably.</p>

<p>The Invincibles who make up the Longfellow circle of <span class="smcap">New
Orleans, La.</span>, entered upon their four years’ work in October.
A friend has kindly given us an account of the work the members
did during the summer months: “The summer circle was
very pleasant; the C. L. S. C. studies not extending through
the summer months, they were thrown on their own resources
for a program. They read regularly from Emerson and Ruskin,
also extracts from Hamerton’s, ‘Intellectual Life,’ Carlyle,
and Dr. Holland, with a bit of poetry now and then. You see
they are not starving, but eating ‘strong meat.’ In October
the circle began the regular readings. Now, when you remember
that though our thermometer runs along in the nineties for
weeks at a time, and that though floods, epidemics and musquitoes
interfere with steady work, these people have gone
bravely through three years, and have done thorough work,
you will not wonder that I am proud of my children.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wyoming Territory</span> sends notice of a new organization of
the C. L. S. C. at <span class="smcap">Evanston</span>, called the “Unita Local Circle.”
The circle was started October 7, and officers—two only, president
and secretary—were elected. The spirit of the circle
they sum up in the following concise and suggestive sentences:
“Enthusiastic devotion to the ‘Chautauqua Idea.’ Plain
informal meetings for mutual questionings, recitations to each
other, map studies, and practical application of new truths
taught, as per example, ‘Resolved, to try every method given
for cooking the potato.’”</p>

<h3>CLASS OF 1885.</h3>

<p class="center">“<i>Press on, reaching after those things which are before.</i>”</p>

<h4>OFFICERS.</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>President</i>—J. B. Underwood, Meriden, Conn.</li>
<li><i>Vice President</i>—C. M. Nichols, Springfield, Ohio.</li>
<li><i>Treasurer</i>—Miss Carrie Hart, Aurora, Ind.</li>
<li><i>Secretary</i>—Miss M. M. Canfield, Washington, D. C.</li>
<li><i>Executive Committee</i>—Officers of the class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Class badges may be procured of either President or Treasurer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The price of our <i>Class Badges</i> is ten cents each.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The price of ’85 class paper is fifty cents per box, to be obtained
of Mr. Henry Hart, P. O. Box 176, Atlanta, Ga.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The office from which the class has been obtaining their
badges has been entirely burned out, and the design of our
badge perished with the other contents. We now expect to
have a copy of the original design within two weeks, and to be
able to furnish more badges by December 1st. It is gratifying
to know that the demand for the Lavender has largely increased
this fall. This indicates a growing interest in the C.
L. S. C. studies this season.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In order that an estimate may be made of the members of
’85 who will take their diplomas at Chautauqua next summer,
it is desired that all expecting to be there will forward their
names to the secretary, Miss M. M. Canfield, Treasurer’s Department,
Third Auditor’s Office, Washington, D. C.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This pleasant testimony to the pleasure of class associations
at Chautauqua many an ’85 will welcome. It is taken from a
letter on Chautauqua which Mr. Underwood has received: “A
very pleasant feature of Chautauqua is the pleasant associations,
and especially is this the case among the members of the
C. L. S. C. A bond of mutual sympathy exists between them.
Reading the same books, with the same object in view, mind
and heart culture, it is no wonder that they are a congenial
company. There I felt a special pleasure. There are so
many, many things to be said in favor of Chautauqua that I
feel I have very imperfectly expressed them. The meeting of
old friends and finding of new ones contributed another of
my pleasant impressions. The recreation afforded by its lovely
lake, its health and rest-giving facilities, its elevating influence
in every way, have won for it well-deserved fame. My Chautauqua
visit will afford me pleasant memories during the coming
years, and if permitted, I hope to repeat it next year, and
one event I shall look forward to with pleasure, will be the
meeting again of our class of ’85.</p>

<h3>CLASS OF ’86.</h3>

<p class="center">“<i>We study for light, to bless with light.</i>”</p>

<h4>CLASS ORGANIZATION.</h4>

<p><i>President</i>—Rev. B. P. Snow, Biddeford, Maine.</p>

<p><i>Vice Presidents</i>—Rev. J. C. Whitley, Salisbury, Maryland; Mr. L.
F. Houghton, Peoria, Illinois; Mr. Walter Y. Morgan, Cleveland,
Ohio; Mrs. Delia Browne, Louisville, Kentucky; Miss Florence Finch,
Palestine, Texas.</p>

<p><i>Secretary</i>—Rev. W. L. Austin, Dunkirk, New York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The class of ’86 feels that it may exercise a little just pride
in the fact that it enters upon its third year with a good 14,000
members, characterized, especially, by earnest, studious application
to the work of the course. The class mean to be true
to their name, the “Progressives,” and they hope that noise
and show may not be the only signs they may give of progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
They trust that ’86 will not fail to make good and continue
to maintain the strong and honorable place it now holds
as a corps of the great C. L. S. C. army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will interest the whole membership of ’86 to know that
Principal Fairbairn, of England, the distinguished lecturer on
Philosophy this season at Chautauqua, accepted with great satisfaction,
an election as honorary member of ’86, and entertains
the warmest interest in his class.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two who have won names in song are among our regular
members, and have been elected class poets. One is the author
of “No Sect in Heaven,” the other has written admirable verses
for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and for other publications. One honored
and earnest member, Professor C. C. Case, will in due
time set to music some of the poetic utterances of these writers
as class songs for ’86.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A special monogram note paper has been prepared for the
class of ’86. It is much admired.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are pained to record the death of our class-mate, Mrs.
Lorica Bennett, of Gilmore, Iowa. Her devotion to the C. L.
S. C. had for a long time been intense, and one of her last requests
was that her testimony to its benefits be added to the
list of those which appear in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE CLASS OF 1888.</h3>

<p>All items of interest pertaining to the class of 1888 should
be sent to C. C. McLean, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are in receipt of a letter from Professor Walton N. Ellis,
Chairman of Motto Committee, notifying us that the selection
made is “Let us be seen by our deeds,” from the Latin <i>spectemur

<h2 id="THE_CHAUTAUQUA_UNIVERSITY">THE CHAUTAUQUA UNIVERSITY.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY PROF. R. S. HOLMES, A.M.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The Chautauqua University is empowered by its charter to
grant the degrees ordinarily conferred by American colleges.
The chief of these are Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science,
Bachelor of Philosophy, and Civil Engineer, to be awarded to
undergraduates at the completion of certain prescribed courses
of study, as the seal of their work and the sign of their graduation.
The degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
are the leading post-graduate degrees. The Chautauqua
University proposes to use the power granted by its charter
whenever the occasion may demand. It believes that good
and thorough study may be done at home; that good and
thorough instruction may be imparted by correspondence; and
when good home study and good instruction by correspondence
are united, it believes that as good and thorough education will
result as results from resident college training, and such education
it proposes to recognize and crown.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua University does not contemplate the bestowal
of degrees upon groups, or ranks, or classes of individuals
who may for certain periods of time have been associated
in the same studies and the same courses. It is the individual
student, as an individual, who will receive the Chautauqua degree,
and not he, until after tests severer than are required of
students in the average college, and after more years than college
students think they can spare from practical life. The
student of the Chautauqua University is in practical life when
he becomes a student, and remains in practical life while he is
a student, consecrating to self culture those spare hours which
his neighbor, who has graduated long ago, spends in idleness
or in restless quest of amusement.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua University does not design to lower the
standard of attainment essential to a degree. This does not
mean cheap diplomas for the masses—it means education for
those who have stood outside the gates of opportunity; it
means lofty purpose, noble aim, self-sacrificing consecration
to culture of mature hours and rigid discipline whose end is
power. This institution opens no door to the multitudes of
youth annually leaving our high schools, through which they
can pass along some royal road to enter the portals and sit
down in the palace of culture. To all of this class who can,
it says go to college; climb the heights of Olympus; sit on
the hill of Helicon; drink at the Pierian spring; walk in the
groves of the academy; seek with Crito to catch Socrates as
he passes out of his prison; put on the buskin; wear the laurel.
For you we have nothing. But for the great majority of
those who, year by year are passing from school into the practical
avenues of life, the multitude who can not go to college,
we rear an altar by the fireside, on which we kindle the fires
of truth, by whose light they shall see clearly to read the
mysteries of that world of knowledge into which their more
fortunate companions have gone; and when the years have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
passed, years of patient toil, of earnest endeavor, of unswerving
purpose, of daily sacrifice upon those altars of spare moments
of time, they, too, shall wear the laurel.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua University has no purpose of swelling
Chautauqua ranks at the expense of established resident institutions.
It offers no allurement to turn young men or young
women away from college. It seeks to foster the college spirit,
to create a desire for intimate knowledge of the liberal arts. It
would see college graduates numbered not by tens, but by
hundreds. It holds high the banner of college education. On
it are inscribed the immortal names of Edwards, Hopkins,
Woolsey, Dwight, and the long illustrious list of those who
have made illustrious the institutions with which they were
connected. It bids the young men of the nation to range
themselves beneath their standard, <i>if they can</i>. But for those
who can not, the young, gifted, anxious, who are longing to
stand beside their former companions, but can not; for those
also who could not, the mature, with vigorous powers, who by
earnest labor and economic care have escaped the environments
of early days, and are able now to give a leisure hour to
study; for those, too, who would not, and who to-day regret
and would atone for the mistake of by-gone days; for all these
we raise the standard of the Chautauqua University, and bid
them range themselves beneath it. <i>Tandem fit surculus arbor</i>—“The
sapling has at last become a tree.”</p>

<p>But while Chautauqua takes this last step upward she forgets
and abandons nothing of her past. The Assembly, with its
years of wonderful influence, goes on to widen that influence.
Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, serving a purpose of
wide usefulness goes on to enlarge that usefulness with ever
increasing numbers. The methods which have made her past
so successful and memorable will characterize her future. The
annual pilgrimage of tens of thousands to the shores of the
beautiful lake will continue. Sermon and lecture, discussion
and conversation, representations of the treasures of art, and
the wonders of science, study and recreation, pathos and zest
will still instruct, delight, arouse and rest her summer multitudes.
But all this does not complete Chautauqua’s work for
the world. There is a higher summit to be reached, and on its
crest is reared the University, and only accurate learning and
close scholarship can speak the open sesame that will give entrance
to her inmost shrines.</p>

<p>It has been the burden of this article to impress our readers
with the idea that diplomas in the Chautauqua University can
not be had on call, but will be awarded only to high attainment
after strenuous toil. But while we would speak on this
subject in language that shall not be misunderstood, we would
not go to the other extreme, and deter any from entering upon
the work. Though our standards are high, they are not too
high to be reached. Art may be long, and time fleeting;
but art is not too long and time is not too fleeting to allow an
earnest man or woman within their time to measure the length
and breadth of the treasures art may hold.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua University appeals to a mighty constituency.
There are a hundred thousand readers who, glancing
over the columns of their daily or weekly paper, will stop to
read with attentive interest the article or item which contains
the word “Chautauqua.” The circle into which their lines of
influence radiate is almost without circumference. That appeal
has been answered. From this constituency, within the
month just ending, hundreds of inquiries, prompted by the article
in the October issue of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, have reached
the University office. They come from the farthest eastward
province of the Dominion of Canada, and from the remotest
southern and western states of the American Union. Chief
among the inquiries has been one concerning the courses of
study to be pursued for the attainment of specific degrees,
prompted, no doubt, by the following paragraph from our preliminary
circular:</p>

<h3>DEGREES.</h3>

<p>Among the degrees to be conferred by the Chautauqua University
on the satisfactory completion by the candidate of prescribed
courses, are the following:</p>

<p>A. B.—A Full Academic Course.</p>

<p>A. M.—A Post-Graduate Course in approved liberal studies.</p>

<p>B. S.—An Elective Course in Science, Art, and English.</p>

<p>Ph. B.—An Elective Academic Course.</p>

<p>Ph. D.—A Post-Graduate Course in Philosophy, and one or
more other liberal studies.</p>

<p>In pursuance of our purpose to show how much we shall require,
and still that such requirement may be met by him who
will, and to answer the inquiries on the subject, we add our
proposed course of study for the diploma and degree of Bachelor
of Arts. This is not sent out as final, or as not subject to
modification. It is, however, substantially the basis of all
work in the Chautauqua University, and is as follows:</p>

<p>The completion of the following courses of study, and the
possession of certificates from the directors of the various departments
which these courses represent, will be required before
the student will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor
of Arts: Two full courses in Greek; three full courses
in Latin; four full courses in Mathematics; two full courses
in French or German; three full courses in English; two full
courses in History; one full course each in Philosophy, Political
Economy, Physics, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, Astronomy,
the History and Literature of Art, and two full courses
in Biological Science. The student will not be required to pursue
these courses exactly as prescribed, as wide opportunity
will be given the individual to substitute other branches than
those named, or more courses in particular departments than
are here specified, as he may elect. But in every case full
courses equal in number to those specified will be required.
For the other degrees the scheme of study now pursued will
form the basis, such omission and substitution being made as
are suited to the particular degree; but in no case will a diploma
be given for less than twenty-two full courses. With
this outline of work before them, students will be able to begin at
once without further inquiry. Select the courses which you will
first attempt; and with purpose never to cease your effort till success
has crowned it, we bid you enter the Chautauqua University.</p>

<h3>A DANGER FOR LOCAL CIRCLES.</h3>

<p>We are often slow to believe that our pet institutions have
points of attack. We become so enamored with their merits
that we close our eyes to their dangers. Particularly is this
true, we fear, in regard to the local circle. Its members rejoice
so heartily in its existence that they are prone at times to forget
that even a local circle is heir to the frailty of all human institutions,
and that it may be threatened by dangers which, unless
arrested, will destroy its usefulness. One danger at a time is
sufficient to consider; certainly so when so serious a one as
narrowness is announced.</p>

<p>The whole plan of the C. L. S. C. is broad—it is literally
for <i>all</i> men. Any department of the work which is conducted
on any other principle fails to discharge its full allegiance. We
fear that the local circle is in danger of losing sight of this great
principle. Most natural is it for circles to so limit themselves.
When a club of ten, twenty or thirty congenial members has been
formed, when a pleasant plan of work has been adopted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
thoroughly organized, it is comfortable and natural to decide that
the circle is large enough; that a larger number would spoil the
informality, would bring in an uncongenial element, would be
unmanageable. The growth of the circle is stopped in the community,
and the harm done is threefold. Probably the most
serious evil is that the exclusiveness of the circle has abridged
the usefulness of the C. L. S. C. Intended for all men who
need a course of reading it naturally asks from its members
fidelity to this underlying catholicity of spirit. The original
plan of its founder did not include the local circle. His idea
was to ask from every reader faithfulness to the broad and inspiring
principle on which he had based the plan. Every member
was to lead others to the well. The local circle has grown
up and is undoubtedly a wonderful help in many ways, but it is
in danger of keeping the C. L. S. C. from the very people
who need it most. A circle once formed, and which has
closed its doors to all outsiders, naturally spreads the idea that
the C. L. S. C. is a sort of a private club, that only certain
kinds of people are admitted, or it is suitable for only such and
such people. Utterly false and harmful in the extreme to the
work, it is but a logical result from this exclusiveness.</p>

<p>An injury almost as deplorable is the encouragement this
limitation gives to the widespread social evil of “sets.” “Our
set” is the bane of church union; it breaks up the harmony
of Sabbath-schools; it divides our towns into a vast number
of petty, jealous cliques. This spirit is contrary to the fundamental
principles of our work, yet we encourage, rather than
hinder it by narrowing our borders in the local circle.</p>

<p>Unless we do open our lines we suffer, ourselves. We lose
the greatest aid which the C. L. S. C. has to offer—the inspiration
which comes from working for a good cause. Sustained
zeal is possible only when fed by unselfishness. Work becomes
nerveless, narrow, crotchety, which has not the inspiration
of being not only a help to oneself, but a help to others.
To omit this labor for others is to leave out a most important
part of the course.</p>

<p>But perhaps, it is argued, this is not practical. We have a
habit, now-a-days, of declaring “not practical” a great many
ideas whose utility is evident, but whose realization is attended
with self-denial and constant effort. Do not be deceived. <i>All</i>
good things are practical, if not always easy. Catholicity in
the C. L. S. C. most certainly is so. Have you a large circle
and do you hesitate before extending its boundaries, then you
should form a second circle. Through the efforts of your
members not only one but any number might be started, until
there would not be a house in your town in which the C. L. S.
C., if not a member, at least would be an acquaintance. These
could meet separately each week, but monthly meetings, memorial
celebrations and vesper services should beheld jointly.
In every city where local circles exist, at least three joint meetings
should occur in the year. Each society should be represented
at these meetings, and provision should be made for
social converse. This plan, so easily arranged, has been successfully
tried in many places. It does not hinder the great
work of a small circle, and removes the danger of narrowness.
It may cost you self-denial and struggle, but the broader
view of your true relations to men which you will get, the inspiration
of seeing the work extended, and the increased
friendliness in the inhabitants of your town will more than
compensate.</p>

<h3>ELECTING A CHIEF MAGISTRATE.</h3>

<p>Under the wholesome rule of the constitution, by which
power regularly returns to the people for a new lease of it, we
have just chosen a President of the United States. It is wise
to remember the things which were <i>not</i> before the people for
their decision. There is, for example, the constitution under
which we live with its securities for all well-defined rights under
a judiciary made as independent as possible. There is
also that system of local self-government vesting in states,
cities, counties and towns, the control of business which is exclusively
their own. There is the general policy of leaving the
people to transact private business for themselves and relieving
them of infantile dependence on the government. What a
contrast to that Roman empire which gave <i>panem et circenses</i>
to the people and reduced the popular conception of government
to that of a good fairy who furnished food and amusement—ran
the bakeries and the theaters! But on the other
hand, we may as wisely remember that a campaign may have
fateful bearings on our dearest interests; highest moralities and
most revered sanctities. It is conceivable that the result of an
election might be the admission of polygamous Utah as a state,
and the consecration of plural marriage as one of the allowable
and honored modes of founding the American family. It is
also conceivable that as the result of an election the laboring
classes might be reduced to distress, and all of us along with
them, by the establishment of free competition between our
workmen and the men in blouses, and the women in wooden
shoes, on the other side of the ocean. It is possible, too, that
a new interpretation of the constitution which would seriously
impair private rights might grow from the results of an election.
Nor can we forget that the <i>spirit</i> of our public life is
powerfully affected by the discussions and the management of
political campaigns. The profuse spending of money to influence
votes, the recklessness which breaks out in ballot-box
stuffing and counting-out frauds is more dangerous than any
proposition to alter the constitution; for it does alter it and
sells out the governing of us to unscrupulous managers.</p>

<p>And therefore it is a happy result of our political system as
our fathers gave it to us, that the people interest themselves in
elections, discourage great changes in our laws, impose a conservative
policy upon parties, demand respect for the sanctities
of the family and of society, and frown upon corrupt practices
in handling the national ballot-boxes or influencing the
nation’s voters by bribes and unlawful promises.</p>

<p>We have for the twenty-fifth time chosen a President. The
office has grown in its burdens, but it has not grown in its
constitutional powers. For ten years there was a great danger
that its wholesome powers would be seriously reduced by
the so-called “courtesy of the Senate,” according to which the
President became the clerk of the Senators for Federal appointments
in each state. But since the pistol shot which
killed President Garfield was fired, the so-called “courtesy”
has ceased to be named except for condemnation; and the
President retains the power Washington had to nominate office-holders
in the several states. Probably there has never been
a time when the highest office was more carefully and exactly
defined by practice in harmony with the constitution. The
President does not dictate to Congress, force nominations
through the Senate, or interfere with the independence of the
Federal courts. On the other hand one may search the newspapers
in vain for a trace of distrust or criticism in any of
these vital concernments. After the war there was a period
during which the constitution underwent severe strain at several
points. The criticisms of the times of Johnson and Grant
turned mostly upon constitutional questions. The conflicts of
politics bore upon that class of differences. To many it seemed
doubtful whether our institutions could survive these struggles.
Providence has been good to us; we have been good to ourselves
and our children. The storms are overpast. The constitution
exists unimpaired; it is universally accepted as the
fundamental law. There has not been a breath of discussion
about it in the late campaign. It is many quadrenniums since
the like occurred; indeed we doubt if there ever was any such
campaign in this respect. Here and there a man may be
found to explain our peace as ignorant indifference; but he is
profoundly wrong. The separate powers of the government
are well defined, and the independence of each in its own domain
is preserved. The single new machine—national supervision
of congressional elections through U. S. Marshals—had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in it great possibilities of danger. It might have been so
handled as to vest the power to hold the ballot-boxes in the
President’s hands; but it has simply created salutary checks
on frauds. Here and there an isolated case of improper interference
may reach the record; but there is no fear abroad
that our chief magistrate abuses his powers. The errors when
they occur are only the blunders of individual officers, not an
organized invasion of the people’s rights. So little has been
said about this piece of machinery recently, that we half fear
that some readers have forgotten or never heard of the Federal
election laws. The sum of what we would say is that the
late election marks the subsidence of those waves of constitutional
disorder or conflict which had run high from the beginning
of the war to the death of President Garfield. We have
evidently entered upon a new field of partisan controversy;
and no constitutional questions, only questions of expediency,
are before us or are likely to be. The industrial problems as
related to tariff questions, perhaps also some others, such as
the expediency of National savings banks and life insurance
bureaus for the poor, are likely to lead the political thought
into channels which were never before open to it in the line of
humanitarianism and the general welfare. In becoming a
manufacturing nation we have traveled to new political outlooks.
We have to adjust ourselves to the results of our tariff
laws, whether or not we like either the laws or its results. The
results are some millions of men and women earning wages in
mills, whose fate and that of their children is in our hands.
We shall be tempted to follies of protection as well as follies
of free trade; to follies of philanthropy as well as follies of indifference
and neglect. To thoughtful men the path to safety
may well seem as narrow as the edge of that scimetar along
which the Moslem saint skated into Paradise. Let us hope
that the conservative genius of our people will not fail in these
new fields of political activity; and that the buoyant hope of
this growing people may continue to lift us out of the dangers
of the failure of self-confidence. It is our happiness that we
feel able to govern ourselves, equal to our problems, superior
to our perils. If it should ever come to pass that the mass of
our citizens lost the self-assurance for which foreigners sometimes
unwisely rebuke them, they would begin to transfer the
government to oligarchies, aristocracies, or “the man on horseback.”
The campaign has had many unpleasant incidents—political
mills can not be clean and quiet any more than other
mills can—but a judicious observer will have noted with satisfaction
that the plain men have everywhere felt equal to forming
their own judgments about grave matters concerning which the
so-called wise have differed most energetically. And inasmuch
as the wise could not agree, it is safe to say that the wayfaring
men have displayed as much sense as “their betters,” and
more courage and consistency. We have been impressed by
the experience of the campaign with the belief that the average
American, who knows neither Latin nor science, does understand
his principal business—that of governing this country.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPAL FAIRBAIRN’S LECTURES.</h3>

<p>The lectures of Principal A. M. Fairbairn, of England, on the
Chautauqua platform last summer, were a valuable contribution
to contemporary philosophy. Their subject is Modern Philosophy
in its specifically English form. Starting with Locke, and
passing along through the ideas of Berkeley, Hume, the Mills,
Comte, and Herbert Spenser, the learned and brilliant lecturer
gave us a history of modern speculation respecting the
problem, “How is knowledge possible? What are its conditions?
How does man come by it?” We have lately read
over again these lectures in the careful reports made for the
<i>Assembly Herald</i>; and we believe we shall render our readers
a service by calling their attention to the importance of them
and reminding those who have not files of them that they are
on sale at this office. There is a very remarkable unity in the
empirical philosophy which is associated with the names we
have just given, and this unity was developed with rare skill by
Principal Fairbairn. John Locke, the English founder of the
school, formulated and determined the problem of philosophy
for the English and the French peoples; and though each of
them was original after his kind, Berkeley, Hume, the Mills,
Comte and Herbert Spenser have worked upon lines which
Locke laid down. Locke asked himself, how do ideas come
into the mind? and answered his question by saying, there
are no ideas in the mind until the senses have conveyed them
in. In other terms, he undertook to disperse as a metaphysical
mist the “innate ideas” in which philosophy believed
when he began to write. In varying forms, the notion
that there is nothing in the mind except what the senses
have put there remains the creed of the empirical philosophy.
The criticism of Principal Fairbairn upon the successive statements
of the doctrine that the outer world is prior, and creates
the inner world, is very keen and accurate. Locke was fond
of saying that the mind was like a clean table, to which the
senses brought ideas. Our critic asks: “Did you ever find a
table that could grasp the significance of what was graved
on it?” and adds, “It is the power to read the writing and
weave it into a connected and reasonable and rational whole,
which is the very thing to be explained. It is not how nature
through the senses comes to me, but how I through the senses
read nature.” And one of his strong and luminous statements
is, that “Ideas can not get into the mind unless there is a mind
to get into.”</p>

<p>The purpose of the critic throughout these lectures was to
establish the priority of thought by disposing one by one of
the various attempts to post-fix mind to matter. The attempts
successively made to attach mind, ideas, thought, conscience,
and philosophy to the tail of the material kite, all tended, of
course, to skepticism. As a theologian Dr. Fairbairn was
instinctively drawn to the task of reversing this order so
as to attach matter as a tail to the kite of the spiritual world.
No matter how plausibly stated, the theory that our knowledge
and our minds are a result of material energy reduces any
possible God to the status of a product of nature. If in reasoning
about ourselves we shall finally conclude that our inner
totality is simply and only a product of the external world, we
shall be forced to conclude that all thought in the universe is
of like origin. The skeptical result is inevitable. Whatever
view we take of substance in nature we are compelled to decide
whether or not it is so moulded as to express the thoughts
of an infinite God. If we so believe we shall find it easy to
explain how thought in us finds a cosmos in nature. If the infinite
mind reveals his thought in the order and harmony of
the external world, the fact easily explains why we <i>find</i> order
and harmony there. It is not necessary to reduce the external
world to a phantasmagoria of the mind in order to vindicate a
place for God. Rather the most subtle and dangerous of skepticisms
may lie in the teaching that innate ideas construct the
harmonies of nature. Berkeley said we are reading God’s
thoughts in the visible world; and hegelianism, to which Principal
Fairbairn evidently leans, dispenses with matter while
filling the universe with thought. It is equally easy to give
matter reality as a plastic thing on which God writes his
thoughts so that we may read them. This question of the reality
of substance may very properly be the next one to command
the attention of philosophy. But it must be remembered
that the science which resolves matter into motion and force
conspires with the philosophy which makes matter merely the
expression of divine ideas.</p>

<p>But we do not wish to make our readers heads ache with
philosophy; only to suggest to those who are interested in it
that these lectures will afford them valuable instruction. At
their close on the Chautauqua platform, Chancellor Vincent
expressed in happy terms the admiration of thousands who
heard these lectures for their vigor and eloquence. He said:
“Principal Fairbairn, in behalf of Chautauqua I desire to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a very few words. We are glad that you came. We are sorry that
you must go. You have commanded our admiration by the
elegance, clearness and force of your diction, but preëminently
by the vigor and freshness of your thought. You stand before
us a great ‘phenomenon.’ [Applause.] For we have been
accustomed to vigorous thought read from manuscript, we have
been accustomed to vigorous thought put into memory and recited
with accuracy, but this living, present, compact, vigorous
thinking on one’s feet, that has held us spell-bound, is a very
remarkable occurrence at Chautauqua.” [Applause.]</p>

<p>The saying “politics makes strange bed-fellows,” never
had a more dramatic exhibition than in the case of Henry
Ward Beecher. In the late campaign, he was violently handled
by the only paper in New York which supported and defended
him in his trial; and he has been on the same side
with the papers which at that time most infamously abused
him. The press is also fairly representative of the public
around him; his life-long friends have now been opposed to
him; and one friend of other years has been branded by him
as “a continental liar,” whatever that may be. “It is,” say
his present friends, “the fate of a prophet.” His older friends
say “he is growing old.”</p>

<p>In England, in one county, 30,000 acres of good land are
tenantless because the laborers and farmers have gone to
manufacturing towns. To cure this evil Lady Catherine Gaskell
wants to put a stop to educating the poor. She is a picturesque
reformer who may be safely classed with the Roman
pontiff. She would forbid the humble classes to wear clothes
such as other people wear, send them to the fields at three
o’clock in the morning, and keep them with the cattle. The

<p>It is said that the Jesuits are creeping back into Rome and
buying property in the names of private persons. The Pope is
very busy and hopeful in his work of strengthening the church.
One aspect of this matter of the Papacy and its Jesuit agents,
is too much overlooked. Italy can not successfully fight either
the Papacy or Jesuitory <i>with atheism</i>. So long as the Catholics
have the religion of the country they will actually rule it,
whatever may be the form of government. A dreadfully perverted
Christianity is still a positive force, advancing and
aggressive. Atheism is not a force; it is a barren negation.
A Protestant Italy is the want of liberty in that peninsula.</p>

<p>Wm. H. Vanderbilt has given $500,000 to the New York
City College of Physicians and Surgeons. The gift is wise
and generous, and it breaks a disagreeable silence. It is only
by such gifts that very rich men can satisfy our moral sense.
The vast wealth can be justified only as a stewardship for
one’s fellow men; and we want to see the proofs that the stewardship
is righteously exercised.</p>

<p>October is the month of political parades in the political almanac.
This year the display at some points was magnificent.
Broadway, New York, with from thirty to sixty thousand men

<p>Now and then a good man is plentifully advertised as “a

<p>The appointment of the Hon. Hugh McCullough as Secretary
of the Treasury reminds us, not only that President Lincoln
nominated him to the same office, but also that he returns
to the most arduous office in the United States at the age of
seventy-three. His health is perfect, and he has the vigor of
middle age. The old men are holding out in American public

<p>Mr. Wm. J. Stillman, an American artist and writer who has

which all who have crossed the Atlantic just once will
appreciate. He proposes that the eating on ocean steamers
be done on the restaurant principle, each passenger paying for
what he eats, at fixed prices. If the plan is adopted, it will
considerably reduce the cost of that trip to Europe of which
most of our readers are dreaming. Eating and a first voyage

<p>It is a very amusing thing (to us Americans) which Professor
Goldwin Smith says in a recent number of the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, that the organization of a government in England can

must be made for modern England. But the Professor
always was hysterical.</p>

<p>The result of the French war in China is still in doubt.
Three months ago the French papers were writing about their
great victory and proposing that their Tonquin army conquer
the Christian queen of Madagascar. Now the latest
public statement is that the army in Tonquin is sufficient for
<i>defensive</i> operations. There is a gradual growth of manifestations
of hostility by the Chinese against all foreigners, and
an outbreak is <i>possible</i> which might arm the Christian world
against China; but that seems to be the only door of escape for
the French from a long and costly war.</p>

<p>The desperate condition of railroad property has been made
more desperate by a rate-cutting war. There are more roads
than are needed, and this state of things reduces the fares and
freights to be divided among an increased number. The result
is a still further reduction by reduced fares of passengers.
The problem of this class of property is a difficult one; and it
is a large one and closely related to the general prosperity. A
first step would seem to be getting speculators out of the directorates.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad recently transported a solid
wheat train containing one hundred and ten cars. Ten years
ago the whole region in which this wheat grew was a wilderness.
But the farthest great wheat field has now been opened

not be scarce. With the rise in price will come a vast increase
of production in the older states.</p>

<p>We are entertained by the solemn pleadings of certain journals
that boys be allowed to take exercise, that the schools be
restrained from spoiling their bodies while cultivating their
minds. Any one who knows a boy when he sees one must
“laugh consumedly” over this reform. Teachers will find
special and boundless amusement in the idea that a boy can
be kept from abundant and even violent exercise.</p>

<p>An interesting side-light on our civilization is the fact that
some of the Sitting Bull Indians have been exhibiting themselves
and their costumes and customs in a New York theater—“to
make money to build houses and buy furniture,” the
manager says. This is more heroic than taking scalps for
glory.</p>

<p>Once when the superior generalship of General Lee was explained
to General Grant, he replied with his usual modesty of
tone: “I believe I beat Lee.” We are reminded of the incident
by an elaborate explanation that England had all the
points of success in her favor, and had them all properly
counted in our two wars with her. And yet—we seem to have
heard that—we came out ahead. These metaphysical victories
are not very satisfactory. Artemas Ward said: “I pulled
my enemy down on top of me and firmly inserted my nose between
his teeth.” Still, his nose got the worst of it.</p>

<p>The humors of campaign politics are often good enough to
keep. After the October election in Ohio a Republican paper
said: “John R. McLean, the Democratic manager, married a
wife a few days before the election, and after the state was lost
to his party, was <i>the only happy Democrat in Ohio</i>.” We hope
Mrs. McLean saw the neat compliment to herself.</p>

<p>Farmers are peaceable people, and yet the lawyers would
starve to death if farmers did not furnish them lawsuits. A
movement is on foot in New York state to settle farmers’ differences
by arbitration. The Patrons of Husbandry recommend
this method, and there is some prospect of its adoption
on a considerable scale. We commend the plain common
sense of it to our agricultural readers.</p>

<p>King Humbert distinguished the throne of Italy by visiting
the plagued cities and following the cholera into hospitals.
The Pope, as the pretender to the temporal throne of Rome,
had to demonstrate also. He has called for an organized assault
by prayer on the heart of the Virgin Mary. It is easier
than visiting plague-infested towns, and safer. But the Pope
proposes to pay those who pray. All who take part in the
“rosary prayer” will get absolution for seven years—not
from cholera, but from their sins.</p>

<p>How many people will be in the world in 2000 A. D.? is one
of the questions pressing for settlement in the heads of statisticians.
It is comforting to know that these interesting and
romantic persons assure us that the United States will have six
hundred millions, if nothing in the nature of a preventing Providence
intervenes. It is a comfort to know that the jury have
no personal interest in this verdict in our favor.</p>

<p>This country will have to make some laws on the subject of
timber. The big forests are rapidly becoming only memories.
We make some kinds of lumber from straw, and iron has
taken the place of other kinds. But the woods have climatic
uses, and a treeless land is exposed to evils more costly than
the value of the timber we are wasting. The annual floods are
one item of the cost of destroying trees; changes of climate,
which can hardly be measured, are another item but little
thought of. The trees are a part of natural economy of the
earth.</p>

<p>Public debts are made with far too much carelessness; but
people who wish to evade taxes so arising, repudiate <i>en masse</i>;
and hence comes the interesting question: “Are we a nation
of rascals?” If one judges by the number of worthless (or
little worth) bonds of all sorts which are in existence, we <i>are</i> a
nation of rascals. There must, in other words, be some rascally
element in the national character, or all these promises
to pay would not be dishonored. The genesis of the good-for-nothing
bonds ought to be written philosophically; that may
be a necessary preface to writing it with a moral purpose.</p>

<p>The Boston <i>Traveler</i> of November 6th contains, in its editorial
department, the following noble compliment to the C. L.
S. C.: “This society that teaches the use of leisure hours and
inspires the men and women of America with an intelligent
aspiration to learn something of all that it is practicable to
learn in home study by imparting the enthusiasm of companionship
in work, has this year almost twice as many ardent,
self-sacrificing students of its curriculum as the combined
membership of all the American colleges from Maine to Washington
Territory. When we consider the influence of a single
collegiate institution, many of whose students attend from parental
rather than personal aspirations, and think how much
money is annually raised through benevolence for them, exceptional
praise is due him who has by his own wit and wisdom,
without financial appeal or charitable pretence, called
into line for the study of history, philosophy, science and literature
nearly double the constituency of all our colleges.”</p>

<p>A story comes from one of the Southern states that a man
recently committed suicide rather than pay his taxes. Of the
two inevitable things, death and taxes, he seems to have preferred,
contrary to the common choice, to suffer death. The
story furnishes a text for a sermon on the modification of general
feeling relative to taxation. The suicide of the story was
a survival; taxes are no longer regarded with aversion; they
are paid, as grocers’ bills are, with equanimity.</p>

<p>The desire to fly “springs eternal in the human breast,” and
the balloon is a very fascinating field of experiment. A
Frenchman seems to have gained a point, and a good one. By
using stored electricity he has succeeded in going where he
wanted to go, moving for four hours against the wind. An
Englishman has invented a means of keeping a balloon at the
same level, he thinks. Perhaps ballooning may yet become a
practical science.</p>

<p>Eccentric opinions sometimes have a fine and ancient flavor
combined with a modern taste. Such is the statement recently
made in a public meeting that insanity is increasing among the
colored people, and that education is the cause of it. The
reader can pick out the two tastes. We fear that the colored
people are not yet educated enough to cause insanity, and we
do not seem to know that education ever caused anybody to
become insane.</p>

<p>Among the “fashions” is the rage for old furniture. Grandmother’s
spinning wheel adorns the parlor, and worm-eaten
old bureaus flank it on either side. But a dealer in this kind
of goods, speaking of course against his rivals in trade, says
that most of this old furniture is made at modern factories.
Even the old spinning wheels are imitated to perfection. A
story—wicked, perhaps—says that a Connecticut man is getting
rich making “Mayflower heirlooms.” Persistent rumors of
this kind will kill the fashion.</p>

<p>One of the notable events of October was the celebration
throughout the world of the hundredth birthday of Sir Joseph
Montefiore, the wealthy Jew whose philanthropy has shed luster

venerable philanthropist has shown what wealth is good for,
and set an example of faithful stewardship which ought not to

<p>Some one has figured out that “just now, in the United
States,” twenty-one deaths in a hundred are caused by violence.
It is safe to avoid this kind of statistics. There is no
means of knowing what the rate of death by violence really
is “just at present,” and it is perfectly certain it is not twenty-one.
It is only seven in England, where statistics are kept.
We keep none except in large cities, but we certainly are not
three times as bloody-handed as Englishmen.</p>

<p>New York had pending in the late election an amendment
to the constitution limiting the debts of towns and cities in the
ratio of population. In Illinois, in 1870, the new constitution
put in force a similar rule. The effect, in many towns, was a
series of “improvements,” carrying the debt up to the constitutional
limit. The towns were ashamed of themselves when
they found that they did not owe as much as the law allowed
them to owe.</p>

<p>The horror of being buried alive is the most blood-curdling
one known to civilized life, and yet cases of people being
buried alive continue to be reported. The death of a woman
at Hornellsville, N. Y., was certified by a physician. She was
removed from the grave, and report says that, though in all
other respects apparently dead, the body perspired freely. It
looks like a case of trance. At all events she was buried too
soon, and it is probable that in other cases bodies are frozen
to death a few hours after apparent death. The whole subject
of trance invites study of a more thorough sort than it has
hitherto had.</p>

<p>Unpunctuality is a seductive vice in social matters. When
a party or a dinner is announced for a given hour, it should
begin at that hour, and not an hour or two later. The French
custom is to allow half an hour for dilatory guests at dinners;
but in other matters the French way is for each of the parties
who have made a rendezvous—unless as duelists—to give the
other half an hour’s margin, which being taken on both sides
makes in all an hour. This system of addition is analogous to
what a Californian said of a big tree—it grew so high that it
took two men and a boy to see to the top.</p>

prohibition is misleading. There were cast at that

monster, Chi-mæˈra, which had long ravaged Lycia. Glaucus was slain
at last by Ajax.</p>

<p>“Braggadocio,” brag-ga-dōˈshĭ-o. Boasting; brag. <i>Braggadocio</i>

biography, literature, philosophy and society.</p>

<p>P. 174.—“An-dromˈa-che.” The daughter of the king of Theˈbe
in Cilicia. Her father and seven brothers were killed at the taking of
Thebe, and she was ransomed. After the fall of Troy, Andromache

contended for his armor with Ulysses, but being defeated, he went mad
and took his own life. The Lesser Ajax, as he was called, was a
prince of the Locricans, and rivaled Achilles in swiftness of foot. He
was drowned while returning to Greece.</p>

<p>“I-domˈe-neus.” The king of Crete, one of the bravest heroes of the
Trojan war.</p>

<p>“Aˈtre-us.” “The two chiefs born to Atreus” were Agamemnon

Age, and to have been set among the stars at its close.</p>

<p>P. 191.—“Voss.” (1751-1826.) A German scholar. His translation
of the “Odyssey” has been, since 1781, the standard German version of
that poem. He made translations of many classical works, wrote on
Grecian mythology, and was a poet of ability.</p>

<p>“Chry-seˈis.” The daughter of a priest of Apollo, captured at Thebe,
and the booty of Agamemnon. Her father solicited her ransom, and
when refused, Apollo sent a plague upon the Greeks. Agamemnon was
obliged to surrender her, and to make good his loss, demanded Briseis,
Achilles’ prize, hence “the wrath of Achilles.”</p>

<p>P. 193.—“Seventh of March.” A speech delivered in Congress by
Webster on March 7, 1850, in which he justified the fugitive slave law.</p>

<p>P. 196.—“Dædˈa-lus.” Fabled to have been an Athenian architect
who, for murder, was condemned to death. He fled to Crete, where he
constructed among other works a labyrinth at Gnosˈsus, or Cnossus, in

<p>P. 202.—“Euˈry-tus.” A legendary hero of Thessaly, said to have
been a famous archer. He instructed Hercules in this art, and even
boasted to be equal to Apollo.</p>

<p>P. 208.—“Dyˈmas.”</p>

<p>P. 210.—“Er-y-manˈthi-an.” Pertaining to a mountain in Arcadia,
famous as the scene of the hunt by Hercules of the Erymanthean boar.</p>

into a cow.</p>

<p>P. 218.—“Echˌe-neˈus;” “La-odˈa-mas;” “Lustral.” Purifying.</p>

<p>P. 219.—“Pon-tonˈo-us.”</p>

<p>P. 222.—“Rha-da-manˈthus;” “Titˈy-us.” A giant of Eubœa,
fabled to have been after death cast into Tartarus, where he lies with
two vultures devouring his liver—a punishment for attempting to violate
Diana.</p>

<p>P. 227.—“De-iphˈo-bus.” A son of Priam. The Greeks went first
to his home on the capture of Troy, being bitter against him, as he was
counted second in valor to Hector, and as he had married Helen on
Paris’ death.</p>

<p>P. 230.—“Eu-rylˈo-chus;” “Pramˈmi-an.”</p>

<p>P. 235.—“An-tinˈo-us.”</p>

<p>P. 239.—“Eu-mæˈus;” “Doˈli-us.”</p>

<p>P. 240.—“Menˈtor.” A firm friend of Ulysses, to whom the latter
confided his property when he went to the Trojan war. Minerva assumed
his form in order to teach Telemachus. “Da-masˈtor;” “Alˈki-mus;”
“Eu-rynˈo-mus;” “Am-phimˈe-don;” “Demˌop-tolˈe-mus;”
“Pei-sanˈder;” “Polˈy-bus.”</p>

<p>P. 241.—“Eu-ryˈa-des;” “Elˈa-tus;” “Cte-sipˈpus;” “Eu-rydˈa-mas.”</p>

<p>P. 242.—“Lei-ocˈri-tus;” “Lei-oˈdes;” “Pheˈmi-us.”</p>

<p>P. 243.—“Laˌer-tiˈa-des.” The son of Laertes. “Meˈdon;”
“Phil-œˈti-us.”</p>

<p>P. 245.—“Eu-rynˈo-me;” “Euˈry-cleiˌa.”</p>

<p>P. 247.—“Acˈto-ris;” “Lamˈpus and Phaˈe-thon.” The goddess
of the morning dawn (Eˈos in Greek, in Latin Au-roˈra). “At the
close of every night rose from the couch of her spouse Tithonus and on
a chariot, drawn by the swift horses, Lampus and Phaethon, she
ascended up to heaven from the river Oceanus, to announce the coming
of the light of day to the gods, as well as to mortals. In the Homeric
poems Eos not only announces the coming sun, but accompanies him
throughout the day, and her career is not complete until the evening;
hence she came to be regarded as the goddess of the daylight.”</p>

<p>P. 249.—“Ciˈcons.” After the capture of Troy Ulysses set out for
home, but was driven by a storm on to the coast of Ismarus, a town of
the Cicones in Thrace, north of the island of Lemnos. He took much
booty from the town, though in the fray several of his men were killed.
The adventures of the company with the Lotus-eaters are told on page
228, and with the Cyclops on page 200. After leaving these giants he
came to the island of the god of the winds, Æolus. This island has been
said to be Lipara, or Strongyle, in the group of Lipara islands, northeast
of Sicily. Ulysses was well treated by Æolus, who gave him a bag
of winds on his departure, which was to carry him home. The companions
of Ulysses, however, opened the bag, and the winds escaped.
The ships were driven back to the island, but Æolus would give no
further help. Six days afterward the fleet arrived at “the wide-gated
Les-try-goˈni-an town,” supposed to be Tel-epˈy-los, in the north of Sicily,
where dwelt the Les-trygˈo-nes, a race of cannibals. Ulysses fared hard
among them, escaping with but one ship. Circe and her wiles are told
on page 230. In Hades Ulysses learned mainly that he was at last to
get safely to Ithaca, providing that he let the herds of Heˈli-os, “the
sun’s kine,” in Thrinacia go unharmed. The “Sirens” lived on an
island somewhere near the western coast of Italy, and sang so sweetly
that all who came that way were forced to stop, when they were destroyed.
Ulysses filled the ears of his companions and fastened himself
to the mast of the ship. Next he came to the rocks called Scylˈla and
Cha-rybˈdis. The former received its name from a fearful monster
with twelve feet, six heads, and a bark like a dog, which dwelt thereon,
and the latter from a being who thrice every day swallowed the waters
of the sea and thrice threw them up. They passed uninjured and came
to Helios’ (the sun’s) land. Ulysses was compelled by his companions
to land, and while he was one day asleep they killed some of the sacred
oxen. When again under way the storms arose which drowned all the
company save Ulysses.</p>

<p>P. 252.—“Ar-keiˈsi-as.”</p>

<p>P. 253.—“Alˈy-bas;” “A-pheiˈdas;” “Pol-y-peˈmon;” “E-perˈi-tus.”</p>

<p>P. 254.—“Par-nasˈsus.” See map, History of Greece. It was on
Mount Parnassus that Au-tolˈy-cus lived. He was a son of Mercury,
and renowned for his robberies.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON CYRUS AND ALEXANDER.</h3>

<p>P. 14.—“As-tyˈa-gēs.”</p>

<p>P. 25.—Names of the nine muses. See “Brief History of Greece,”
page 73, and note in Cyrus and Alexander.</p>

<p>P. 29.—The mother of Cyrus was named Pa-rysˈa-tis. There is a brief
reference to her in “Preparatory Greek Course,” page 65. The attempt on
the part of Cyrus to assassinate his brother is denied by some writers.
From the “Introduction” to “Kendrick’s Anabasis” the following
quotation is taken: “During the last illness of his father, Cyrus was
summoned to his bedside, and with Tissaphernes as an ostensible friend,
and with three hundred Greeks he went up to the capital, with strong
hopes, doubtless, that the question of the succession to the throne might
be decided in his favor; the queen-mother espousing his cause, and he
being, though not the oldest son, yet the oldest son born after Cyrus was
king. He was disappointed in his hopes; and, not only so, but, through
the accusations of Tissaphernes, was even seized on charge of a conspiracy,
and escaped death only through the powerful intercession of his
mother, Parysatis. Being dismissed from the court, he returned to his
satrapy, burning with resentment, and determined, if possible, to shake
off all dependence on his brother by succeeding to the throne. He immediately
commenced a secret mustering of the troops needed for so
great an enterprise.”</p>

<p>P. 30.—“The Auxiliary army,” from Greece. “The Peloponnesian
War had just come to a close, and had released from service large numbers
of trained soldiers, fond of war, and ready to enlist, as soldiers
of fortune, in any enterprise that promised success and good pay.”

<p>P. 42.—“Mitˈri-daˈtes.”</p>

<p>P. 51.—“Ar-temˈba-ris.”</p>

<p>P. 75.—“Sacian.” The Sacians, or Saciæ, were one of the numerous
and most powerful of the Scythian nomad tribes, and had their
abodes northeast of the Massagetæ, in the steppes of Central Asia. They
were made tributary to the Persian empire, and were among the best
troops that the kings of Persia had. They were very warlike, and excelled
especially as cavalry. The name of the Sacians is often used
loosely for other Scythian tribes, and sometimes for Scythians in general.</p>

<p>P. 168.—“The celebrated fifth proposition of the first book.” If two
sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite these sides are
equal.</p>

<p>P. 178.—“Tmolus,” moˈlus; “Hyrædes,” hy-rēˈdes.</p>

<p>P. 193.—“Belus.” Son of Neptune. He was believed to be the
ancestral hero and national divinity of several eastern nations. He was
the same as the god Baal, of whom we read in the Scriptures, and, perhaps,
the one known to the Phœnicians as Moloch. His temples were
built on the tops of high hills, or still more frequently in solemn groves,
and sometimes altars were erected to him on the roofs of houses. Incense
was the most frequent offering presented to him, but we also read

<h3>WHAT ENGLISH IS.</h3>

<p id="english1"><a href="#anch_english1">1.</a> “Arretez-donc, Alphonse, arretez-donc.” A literal translation
would be, Stop then, Alphonso, stop then.</p>

<p id="english2"><a href="#anch_english2">2.</a> “Enfeoffed,” en-feftˈ. 1. To invest with a dignity; to convey as a
fee. 2. To surrender; to give up.</p>

<p id="english3"><a href="#anch_english3">3.</a> “Terra North Manorum.” Land of the North-men.</p>

<p id="english4"><a href="#anch_english4">4.</a> “Rubrics.” Those parts of any work which in ancient manuscripts
were colored red, to distinguish them from other parts, especially
the title pages.</p>

<p id="english5"><a href="#anch_english5">5.</a> “Genevan Bible.” This famous Bible appeared in 1557, so called
because the translation was made in Geneva by several English divines
who had fled from the persecutions of the bloody Mary. It was long
the favorite version of the English Puritans. It was accompanied by
notes. Sometimes the name Breeches Bible is given to it, on account of
the rendering of Gen. iii:7. “Then the eyes of them both were opened,
and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves <i>breeches</i>.” The authorized version, or
<i>King James’s Bible</i>, has been in common use for over 250 years. In
1604 the king wrote a letter, intimating the appointment of fifty-four
scholars for the preparation of the version, though only forty-seven
undertook it. The work of translation and revision occupied three
years. The superiority of their work soon proved itself, for in forty years
all versions had quietly succumbed to it; it became <i>the English Bible</i>.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY READINGS.</h3>

<p id="sunday1"><a href="#anch_sunday1">1.</a> “Trajan’s Pillar.” A celebrated column at Rome, which was
reared 114 A. D. by the Romans, in honor of Trajan, the emperor. It
is considered one of the noblest structures of its kind ever erected. A
very remarkable series of bas-reliefs, forming a spiral round the shaft,
exhibits a continuous history of the military achievements of Trajan.
The pedestal is covered with bas-reliefs of warlike instruments, shields
and helmets. These are all in excellent preservation, and, independent
of their beauty as works of art they are invaluable as records of ancient
costume. A spiral staircase in the interior of the column leads to its summit.
Its height is 132 feet. It still stands erect in all its ancient beauty.</p>

<p id="sunday2"><a href="#anch_sunday2">2.</a> “Pompey’s Amphitheater.” The first permanent stone theater
was erected in Rome by Pompey, B. C. 55. It contained seats for
40,000, and was adorned with a profusion of gold, marble and precious
stones, such as the western world had never before witnessed. That
such magnificence might not seem to be lavished upon a mere luxury,
a temple was attached to it dedicated to Venus the Conqueror, so placed
that the seats of the theater might serve as a flight of steps to the sacred
edifice. At the dedication of this famous theater Pompey treated the
people to all sorts of games. There was a combat in which five hundred
lions were slain; but above all, the battle of the elephants was a
spectacle full of horror. Eighteen elephants were made to fight with
trained bands of gladiators, and the cries of these half-reasoning beasts
were such that they moved even that hardened populace to pity, and thus
dampened the excitement of the day.</p>

<p id="sunday3"><a href="#anch_sunday3">3.</a> “Tuscan Urns.” The finest ware used for vases is that known as
Samian, of the potteries of Tuscany. It is remarkable for its rich, red
color. The vases are thin and delicate, and are looked upon as models
of perfection in form, structure, and style of ornamentation.</p>

<p id="sunday4"><a href="#anch_sunday4">4.</a> “St. Cyprian,” cyˈpri-an. (200-258 A. D.) Bishop of Carthage.
He was converted from paganism to the Christian religion; was banished
from Carthage in the time of Valerian, during the persecutions,
but was soon re-called and condemned to death. Cyprian was both a
learned and eloquent divine, but he was even more conspicuous for his
dignified, moderate and wise conduct. His knowledge of human nature
enabled him to exercise a wide influence; and his correspondence,
from which the best idea of his character is obtained, gives an interesting
picture of the times in which he lived.</p>

<h3>GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT GREEK LIFE.</h3>

<p id="greeklife1"><a href="#anch_greeklife1">1.</a> “Chiton,” kīˈton; “Peplos,” pepˈlos. (See “Brief History of
Greece,” p. 81.)</p>

<p id="greeklife2"><a href="#anch_greeklife2">2.</a> “Himation,” hī-maˈtion. (See “Brief History of Greece,” p. 85;
note.)</p>

<p id="greeklife3"><a href="#anch_greeklife3">3.</a> “Archytas,” ar-kīˈtas. (About 400 B. C.) He was one of the
most illustrious men of antiquity. He was seven times elected general
of his city (Tarentum), though it was customary for the office to be held
only for one year. He was a philosopher, mathematician, and a writer.
Only fragments of his works remain; they relate to metaphysics, ethics,
logic and physics.</p>

<p id="greeklife4"><a href="#anch_greeklife4">4.</a> “Italian Morra,” morˈrä. A simple game, played with the fingers
and requiring expertness. If played by only two, standing by a table,
one lays on it—say <i>three</i> fingers—and calls out some different number,
say <i>five</i>. The other speaks and acts at the same instant, giving also a
number; and simultaneously puts down his fingers. If the whole number
of fingers on the table match or equal the number given by either,
the other “makes his point” and tallies one. Repeating the trial, say
ten times, he who makes the most points wins.</p>

<p id="greeklife5"><a href="#anch_greeklife5">5.</a> “School.” See “Brief History of Greece,” p. 67; note.</p>

<p id="greeklife6"><a href="#anch_greeklife6">6.</a> “Palæstra,” pa-lesˈtra. A school or place for athletic exercises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p id="greeklife7"><a href="#anch_greeklife7">7.</a> “Phocylides,” pho-cylˈi-des. (About 560 B. C.) An Ionian
poet. His poetry has come down to us in fragments, only about eighteen
in number, and is chiefly lyric and reflective.</p>

<p id="greeklife8"><a href="#anch_greeklife8">8.</a> “Learn by heart.” During the most flourishing period of Athenian
literature manuscripts were indifferently written, without marks of
punctuation. They were scarce and costly, and could only be read by
those who had literary training. Under these circumstances the Greeks
could never become a reading people, and they became acquainted with
the productions of their poets, only by hearing them recited in public
by bards or rhapsodists, the latter being a body of professional reciters.
It is said when Pisistratus wished to make a collection of the poems
of Homer, he offered sums of money to as many of this class as would
come to him and repeat, before a copyist, all of the parts that they had
learned by heart.</p>

<p id="greeklife9"><a href="#anch_greeklife9">9.</a> “Barathrum.” Literally a deep, or abyss, used as a name for the
lower world.</p>

<p id="greekmyth2"><a href="#anch_greekmyth2">2.</a> “Disˈcus.” A quoit, or circular and usually perforated plate of
metal or stone, used for pitching at a mark. Pitching quoits was a favorite
amusement among the ancients, and forms the subject for frequent
artistic representations. The most famous is Myron’s statue called the
“Discobolus,” now in the British Museum.</p>

<p id="greekmyth3"><a href="#anch_greekmyth3">3.</a> “Hyacinth.” In ancient times, it is said, there could be traced
on the leaves of the hyacinth the Greek characters which express the
word <i>alas</i>. Thus in his “Song of Silenus,” just published, Cole speaks of</p>

<div class="verse">“The flowers the name still bearing which Apollo’s favorite bore,</div>
<div class="verse i1">With the syllable of sorrow marked upon them evermore.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The origin of the hyacinth is also thus related: When Ajax (see
notes on “Preparatory Greek”) took his own life there sprung up from
his blood a purple flower, bearing the Greek letters which were the initials
of his name and expressive of a sigh.</p>

sown oats, literally.</p>

<p id="kitchen3"><a href="#anch_kitchen3">3.</a> “Lake habitations.” These are dwellings constructed within the
margins of lakes, at some distance from the shore. Researches on the
continent have established the fact that in prehistoric times nearly all
the shallow lakes in Switzerland and the adjoining countries were
peopled by lake-dwelling communities. Their villages were constructed
on platforms which were supported by piles. Many of the huts
which were built on these substructures were roughly constructed of
branches of trees; the floors were of clay and the roofs were thatched.</p>

<h3>HOME STUDIES IN CHEMISTRY.</h3>

<p id="chemistry1"><a href="#anch_chemistry1">1.</a> “Grotto del Cane,” grotˈto del caˈnā. Grotto of the dog. An
excavation at the foot of a hill not far from Naples. The “American
Cyclopædia” says of it: “It would seem from Pliny’s reference to it
as ‘Charon’s ditches,’ that in his time the mephitic gas for which it is
still remarkable was exhaled in quantity sufficient to prove fatal to human
life. At the present time this forms but a shallow stratum on the
floor, in which a candle is extinguished and dogs are stifled by way of
experiment. The custom of exhibiting the effect of the carbonic acid
gas upon dogs has given the distinctive name to the grotto.”</p>

<p id="chemistry2"><a href="#anch_chemistry2">2.</a> “Kilkenny Cats.” “The story of two cats which fought so ferociously
in a saw pit that when the battle was over only the tail of each
was left. This is an allegorical representation of the municipalities of
Kilkenny and Irish-town, who contended so stoutly about boundaries
and rights to the end of the seventeenth century that they mutually impoverished
each other—ate each other up, leaving only a tail of each
behind.”</p>

<p id="chemistry3"><a href="#anch_chemistry3">3.</a> “Babcock’s Fire Extinguisher.” This instrument consists of an
iron cylinder, in which are placed suitable quantities of the materials
that, uniting, generate carbonic acid gas. There is an arrangement in
the extinguisher by which the materials are brought in contact, and the gas
when needed is instantly generated; as provision is made for its egress a
stream can be poured on the flame to extinguish it.</p>

<p id="chemistry4"><a href="#anch_chemistry4">4.</a> “Fire Grenade,” gre-nādeˈ. A hollow ball in which the gas is
generated and which is thrown into the flames. The gas escaping extinguishes
the fire.</p>

<p id="chemistry5"><a href="#anch_chemistry5">5.</a> “As-phyxˈi-a.” Apparent death resulting from suffocation,
drowning, or inhalation of certain gases.</p>

obeyed my voice.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—When the fullness of the time was
come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,
made under the law, to redeem them that were
under the law.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i>—And the Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the
glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—He shall be great, and shall be called
the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall
give unto him the throne of his father David.</p>

Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall
be no end.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And thou shalt call his name JESUS;
for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>

<h3>ANTHEM BY THE CHOIR.</h3>

<h3>THE ANGELS TELL OF HIS COMING.</h3>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch
over their flock by night.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i>—And, lo, the angel of the Lord came
upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
round about them; and they were sore afraid.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And the angel said unto them, Fear
not; for, behold, I bring you tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i>—For unto you is born this day in the
city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host praising
God, and saying,</p>

<p><i>Con.</i>—Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And it came to pass, as the angels were
gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds
said one to another, Let us now go even
into Bethlehem, and see this thing which is
come to pass, which the Lord hath made
known unto us.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i>—And when they had seen it, they made
known abroad the saying which was told them
concerning this child.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i>—And the shepherds returned, glorifying
and praising God for all the things that they
had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</p>

<p>Four neatly printed, well bound, illustrated books, edited for boys by
Sidney Lanier, appear as Christmas books, and happy boys indeed will
all those be who receive any or all of them as presents. The very mention
of good King Arthur, although little more than his name may be
known, seems to act as a charm upon boyish hearts and fascinate them
with its spell. And now that they can read all about him,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and how he
organized his famous Knights of the Round-Table, about the search for
the holy cup, Sir Tristram, and all the rest, they will find the old charm
working with increased power, and will be fairly surprised at the endless
fascination of the story.</p>

<p>Froissart five hundred years ago wrote a history of the wars of his
times, in which occurred the battle of Crecy, where the blind old king
of Bohemia fell, the battle of Poitiers, and the Siege of Calais; an account
of an expedition against the Saracens, and much about the old-time
knights. And now this old book, which has lived, and grown in
esteem for so long, has been condensed and rewritten<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> especially for the
boys. If they read aright, the true spirit of knighthood must take possession
of them as they read these knightly tales.</p>

<p>“The Boy’s Percy”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> is a collection of old ballads of war, adventure,
and love. We read in rhyme of Robin Hood and his amazing marksmanship.
There is the “Ballad of Chevy Cace,” and the “Friars
Gray,” “The legend of Sir Guy,” “St. George and the Dragon,” and
many others. And as we read these all seem to emerge and stand out
“like rich tapestry work, wrought large as life” upon the hangings of
our living room.</p>

<p>And then comes a collection of twelve Welsh legends<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of King Arthur
and his knights, giving to the readers of our times the quaint old
fancies of the people of Wales in years gone by. At the close of his
introduction to this book Mr. Lanier says: “I can wish my young readers
few pleasures of finer quality than that surprised sense of a whole
new world of possession which came to me in my first reading of these
old tales.”</p>

<p>There is a new edition of Hawthorne’s “Wonder Book.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Ever
since the author put into effect his idea that classical myths were capable
of being rendered into very capital reading for the children, this book
has been a marvel to childhood. This new edition has the additional
charm of being illustrated by the able hand of Mr. F. S. Church.</p>

<p>“The Story of Vitean,”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> from Frank Stockton’s lively pen, proved a
great favorite in <i>St. Nicholas</i>, some time ago, and now that it has been
gathered into a book will be a real addition to anybody’s library. It is
a story of the thirteenth century, of knights of the <i>cotereaux</i>, of the Inquisition,
and of marvelous adventures. The boy heroes and their opposites
make a story of wonderful interest.</p>

<p>“The Wagoner of the Alleghanies”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> is another favorite poem which
appears in a new Christmas dress. The cover is not pretty, but the
printing and paper are, and the illustrations are engravings of great
merit.</p>

<p>A little time spent with Messrs. Geo. H. Boughton and Edwin A.
Abbey’s delightful “Rambles”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> quite dispels any prejudice which we
may have against Holland as an uninteresting country. These gentlemen
have proven in their book that she possesses picturesque people. These
“sketchable” fisher-folk, these stout lasses and round Dutchmen have
furnished subjects for a collection of charming pictures which, with the
interesting text furnished by Mr. Boughton, make an unusually fine volume.</p>

<p>“Uncle Lawrence” has again furnished his young friends with a capital
story<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> which has the rare merit of teaching them a great many
things without boring them at all. The queer ideas and experiments of
Miss Mollie, the little heroine, are very entertaining. The book is
largely an adaptation from the French.</p>

<p>The most complete edition of Lord Tennyson’s works<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> yet issued is
the collection by the Harpers. It has the merit of being complete and
exact; beside, the book is enriched by good illustrations, and has as an
introduction a very excellent sketch of Tennyson, reprinted from <i>Harper’s
Magazine</i> for December 1883.</p>

<p>The beautiful “Artists’ Edition” of “Gray’s Elegy,” which Messrs.
Lippincott &amp; Co. gave us last holiday time is out this year in a smaller
but equally choice form.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> The engravings in these books are exceedingly
fine.</p>

<p>A really funny book is a rarity, but it is a rarity found in “Stuff and
Nonsense.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> Mr. Frost has surpassed himself in the grotesque pictures
he has put to his nonsensical rhymes. Particularly laughable are his
picture stories, “A Fatal Mistake,” and “The Balloonists.”</p>

<p>Among the picture-and-song books for young folks, “Stories in Rhyme
for Holiday Time”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> is particularly desirable. The rhymes are quite
good, and the pictures better than in the average book of this kind.
Among the rhymes, “Bob’s Bicycle Ride” will be found most entertaining,
and “Eglantine, or The Magical Gloves” is a beautiful fairy
story.</p>

<p>Shakspere’s Seven Ages of Man furnishes the text for an elegant holiday
volume<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> of full page photogravures. These illustrations are from
well known paintings, notable among them being Church’s “Infant”
and Harper’s “School Boy.” It is a very choice book.</p>

<p>Mr. Shepard in simplifying Josephus has met a want of the times.
These old masterpieces of literature which it used to be thought only
mature minds could comprehend, rewritten into simpler language for
young readers can not fail of bringing about grand results. The “Young
Folks’ Josephus”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> is written in language that any scholar in the fourth
reader class can readily understand and enjoy.</p>

<p>The story of two fun-loving, manly boys who lived in Compton,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> is
full of rich humor, and many a hearty laugh is enjoyed over its pages.
The scrapes they got into, and some of their original methods of trying
to get out again are set forth in such a vivid manner that one feels almost
as if he had been through them himself. And the fact that one of these
boys was white and the other black only heightens the interest of the
book.</p>

<p>“Country Cousins,”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> although it does not belong to the older people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seems to be especially interesting to them. The New York <i>Tribune</i>
says, in answer to one of its correspondents; “Mrs. ⸺ will find
‘Country Cousins’ pleasant reading in natural history.” It might have
said, too: If any boy or girl wants to know about birds, or toads, or
elks, or tree-chopping, or all kinds of shells, and ever so many other
things, they can all be found illustrated and fully described in “Country
Cousins.”</p>

<p>The last of the entertaining Bodley books<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> opens by presenting to the
reader a group of six persons sitting on the deck of a steamer which
was just casting off from Hull for a voyage to Scandinavia. They go
as far north as any one can go, and see the sun at midnight; they visit
the fiords, and the principal mountains, and all leading places of interest;
they seek out the home of Hans Christian Andersen and Thorwaldsen;
and after spending several months in this way return to their
home in the United States.</p>

<p>“The Voyage of the Vivian”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> is an account of an expedition to the
North Pole. It presents an array of facts upon a groundwork of fiction.
The facts have been taken from accounts made by explorers from the
earliest time down to the present. As these explorers pass into those
far-away frozen regions they recall and relate the experiences of the real
characters who had been there before them. The author indulges in a
little that is purely imaginary. He allows his crew to reach the open
Polar Sea, “and explore islands and waters which are as yet concealed
from mortal vision.” The book is designed for young readers, but those
of mature minds will find it very entertaining. It is finely illustrated,
many whole page pictures being given.</p>

<p>“My Aunt Jeanette”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> is a very readable book; albeit some passages
do bring a certain moisture to the eyes and a mist over the page that,
for a time, interrupts the reading. It is the plainest kind of a narrative,
without special literary merit, and the farthest remove from anything
sensational. The reader is without ceremony introduced to a rural New
England community, with the characteristics of New England of eighty
years ago. He meets the settled pastor, and members of his flock, and
finds them mostly worthy people, and decidedly religious. The principal
character is so well drawn that, having laid the book aside, the image
has the distinctness of a real presence.</p>

<p>“Wall Street in History”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> is a book well written and beautifully
illustrated. It gives a concise, but clear, reliable history of that famous
locality, and some events that have given it a world-wide celebrity.
The maps, sketches, and numerous portraits add interest to the history,
and give the varying aspects of the place from its primitive to its present
condition. The site, at first a picturesque tangle of underbrush and
wild vines, was partially reclaimed from its wilderness state by constructing
there a wooden wall, which, for half a century, fenced in the city,
and subsequently gave its name to a street where business is now transacted
on a larger scale, and with more tremendous results than at any
other place on the continent.</p>

<p>A collection of some thirty of Dr. O. W. Holmes’s poems<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> has just
been made by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., which for illustrations, typography
and binding is a marvel of beauty. The frontispiece, a portrait of
Dr. Holmes, is a real treasure. It is an etching by S. A. Schoff, and
far surpasses anything of the kind we have ever seen of the genial
doctor.</p>

<p>The Adventures of Robin Hood could not be better told than they
have been by Howard Pyle.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> From the time he starts Merry Robin to
the shooting match at Nottingham Town up to the sad hour of his death
there is not a dull page in the book. The publishers have chosen a
delightful make-up, with Old English style of illustrations, with numerous
head and tail-pieces, and a sprinkling of red ink and queer devices.</p>

<p>We hope that the plan adopted in this issue, of marking the
words in the Required Readings in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> which
are annotated, with a figure, will meet with the approval of our
readers. Many requests have been received asking for
some plan of marking the words on which notes had been
made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The course of study as it appears in the Popular Educational
circular in this issue of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> is complete
and correct. It was found necessary to revise the course somewhat
after its first appearance in the circular, hence the difference
between the course as it first appeared and as it now is
given.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Vesper Service which appears in this issue of <span class="smcap">The

It can be procured at our office in quantities, if desired. See

<h3>SUBSTITUTIONS.</h3>

<p>It is earnestly desired that all members of the C. L. S. C.
will read the appointed and required books.</p>

<p>Substitutes can be accepted only where pupils are too poor
to purchase new works.</p>

<p>It is not allowable for local circles, committees or chairmen
to choose other than the appointed readings.</p>

<p>Any other policy would be disastrous to the aims of the
C. L. S. C.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
